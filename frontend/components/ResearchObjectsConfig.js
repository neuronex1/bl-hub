    abstract: "Irrespective of the many strategies focused on dealing with spinal cord injury (SCI), there is still no way to restore motor function efficiently or an adequate regenerative therapy. One promising method that could potentially prove highly beneficial for rehabilitation in patients is to re-engage specific neuronal populations of the spinal cord following SCI. Targeted activation may maintain and strengthen existing neuronal connections and/or facilitate the reorganization and development of new connections. BioLuminescent-OptoGenetics (BL-OG) presents an avenue to non-invasively and specifically stimulate neurons; genetically targeted neurons express luminopsins (LMOs), light-emitting luciferases tethered to light-sensitive channelrhodopsins that are activated by adding the luciferase substrate coelenterazine (CTZ). This approach employs ion channels for current conduction while activating the channels through treatment with the small molecule CTZ, thus allowing non-invasive stimulation of all targeted neurons. We previously showed the efficacy of this approach for improving locomotor recovery following severe spinal cord contusion injury in rats expressing the excitatory luminopsin 3 (LMO3) under control of a pan-neuronal and motor-neuron-specific promoter with CTZ applied through a lateral ventricle cannula. The goal of the present study was to test a new generation of LMOs based on opsins with higher light sensitivity which will allow for peripheral delivery of the CTZ. In this construct, the slow-burn <i>Gaussia</i> luciferase variant (sbGLuc) is fused to the opsin CheRiff, creating LMO3.2. Taking advantage of the high light sensitivity of this opsin, we stimulated transduced lumbar neurons after thoracic SCI by intraperitoneal application of CTZ, allowing for a less invasive treatment. The efficacy of this non-invasive BioLuminescent-OptoGenetic approach was confirmed by improved locomotor function. This study demonstrates that peripheral delivery of the luciferin CTZ can be used to activate LMOs expressed in spinal cord neurons that employ an opsin with increased light sensitivity.

    abstract: "Understanding percepts, engrams and actions requires methods for selectively modulating synaptic communication between specific subsets of interconnected cells. Here, we develop an approach to control synaptically connected elements using bioluminescent light: Luciferase-generated light, originating from a presynaptic axon terminal, modulates an opsin in its postsynaptic target. Vesicular-localized luciferase is released into the synaptic cleft in response to presynaptic activity, creating a real-time Optical Synapse. Light production is under experimenter-control by introduction of the small molecule luciferin. Signal transmission across this optical synapse is temporally defined by the presence of both the luciferin and presynaptic activity. We validate synaptic Interluminescence by multi-electrode recording in cultured neurons and in mice <i>in vivo</i>. Interluminescence represents a powerful approach to achieve synapse-specific and activity-dependent circuit control <i>in vivo</i>.

    abstract: "In genetic and pharmacological models of neurodevelopmental disorders, and human data, neural activity is altered within the developing neocortical network. This commonality begs the question of whether early enhancement in excitation might be a common driver, across etiologies, of characteristic behaviors. We tested this concept by chemogenetically driving cortical pyramidal neurons during postnatal days 4–14. Hyperexcitation of Emx1-, but not dopamine transporter-, parvalbumin-, or Dlx5/6-expressing neurons, led to decreased social interaction and increased grooming activity in adult animals. In vivo optogenetic interrogation in adults revealed decreased baseline but increased stimulus-evoked firing rates of pyramidal neurons and impaired recruitment of inhibitory neurons. Slice recordings in adults from prefrontal cortex layer 5 pyramidal neurons revealed decreased intrinsic excitability and increased synaptic E/I ratio. Together these results support the prediction that enhanced pyramidal firing during development, in otherwise normal cortex, can selectively drive altered adult circuit function and maladaptive changes in behavior. <a class=bl-link href='https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.18.911347v1?rss=1' target='_blank'>Read more about this work on bioRxiv</a>, in the journal <a class='bl-link' href='https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004221001255' target='_blank'><i>iScience</i></a>, and on <a href='https://neuronex.org/news/19' target='_blank' class='bl-link'>neuronex.org</a>."

Among these FPs are the brightest green fluorescent protein (GFP) homolog yet characterized and a reversibly photochromic FP that responds to UV and blue light. Beyond green emitters, <i>Aequorea</i> species express purple- and blue-pigmented chromoproteins (CPs) with absorbances ranging from green to far-red, including 2 that are photoconvertible.

    abstract: '<i>In vivo</i> fluorescence miniature microscopy has recently proven a major advance, enabling cellular imaging in freely behaving animals. However, fluorescence imaging suffers from autofluorescence, phototoxicity, photobleaching and non-homogeneous illumination artifacts. These factors limit the quality and time course of data collection. Bioluminescence provides an alternative kind of activity-dependent light indicator. Bioluminescent calcium indicators do not require light input, instead generating photons through chemiluminescence. As such, limitations inherent to the requirement for light presentation are eliminated. Further, bioluminescent indicators also do not require excitation light optics: the removal of these components should make a lighter and lower cost microscope with fewer assembly parts. While there has been significant recent progress in making brighter and faster bioluminescence indicators, the advances in imaging hardware have not yet been realized. A hardware challenge is that despite potentially higher signal-to-noise of bioluminescence, the signal strength is lower than that of fluorescence. An open question we address in this report is whether fluorescent miniature microscopes can be rendered sensitive enough to detect bioluminescence. We demonstrate this possibility <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> by implementing optimizations of the UCLA fluorescent miniscope v3.2. These optimizations yielded a miniscope (BLmini) which is 22% lighter in weight, has 45% fewer components, is up to 58% less expensive, offers up to 15 times stronger signal and is sensitive enough to capture spatiotemporal dynamics of bioluminescence in the brain with a signal-to-noise ratio of 34 dB. <a class=bl-link href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9175375" target=_blank>Read more about this work on IEEE <i>Xplore</i></a> and <a class=bl-link href="https://repository.library.brown.edu/viewers/stream/bdr:1128451/" target=_blank>watch a video of Dmitrijs presenting this work</a>.'

    abstract: 'BioLuminescent (BL) light production can modulate neural activity and behavior through coexpressed OptoGenetic (OG) elements, an approach termed ‘BL-OG.’ Yet, the relationship between BL-OG effects and bioluminescent photon emission has not been characterized <i>in vivo</i>. Further, the degree to which BL-OG effects strictly depend on optogenetic mechanisms driven by bioluminescent photons is unknown. Crucial to every neuromodulation method is whether the activator shows a dynamic concentration range driving robust, selective, and non-toxic effects. We systematically tested the effects of four key components of the BL-OG mechanism (luciferin, oxidized luciferin, luciferin vehicle, and bioluminescence), and compared these against effects induced by the Luminopsin-3 (LMO3) BL-OG molecule, a fusion of slow burn <i>Gaussia</i> luciferase (sbGLuc) and <i>Volvox</i> ChannelRhodopsin-1 (VChR1). We performed combined bioluminescence imaging and electrophysiological recordings while injecting specific doses of Coelenterazine (substrate for sbGluc), Coelenteramide (CTM, the oxidized product of CTZ), or CTZ vehicle. CTZ robustly drove activity in mice expressing LMO3, with photon production proportional to firing rate. In contrast, low and moderate doses of CTZ, CTM, or vehicle did not modulate activity in mice that did not express LMO3. We also failed to find bioluminescence effects on neural activity in mice expressing an optogenetically non-sensitive LMO3 variant. We observed weak responses to the highest dose of CTZ in control mice, but these effects were significantly smaller than those observed in the LMO3 group. These results show that in neocortex <i>in vivo</i>, there is a large CTZ range wherein BL-OG effects are specific to its active chemogenetic mechanism. <a class=bl-link href=" https://doi.org/10.1002/jnr.24498" target="_blank">Read more about this work in the Journal of Neuroscience Research</a>.'

      abstract: 'In Bioluminescent Optogenetics (BL‐OG) a biological, rather than a physical, light source is used to activate light‐sensing opsins, such as channelrhodopsins or pumps. This is commonly achieved by utilizing a luminopsin (LMO), a fusion protein of a light‐emitting luciferase tethered to a light‐sensing opsin. Light of the wavelength matching the activation peak of the opsin is emitted by the luciferase upon application of its small molecule luciferin, resulting in activation of the fused opsin and subsequent effects on membrane potential. Using optimized protocols for culturing, transforming, and testing primary neurons in multi electrode arrays, we systematically defined parameters under which changes in neuronal activity are specific to bioluminescent activation of opsins, rather than due to off‐target effects of either the luciferin or its solvent on neurons directly, or on opsins directly. We further tested if there is a direct effect of bioluminescence on neurons. Critical for assuring specific BL‐OG effects are testing the concentration and formulation of the luciferin against proper controls, including testing effects of vehicle on LMO expressing and of luciferin on nonLMO expressing targets. <a class=bl-link href=" https://doi.org/10.1002/jnr.24313" target="_blank">Read more about this work in the Journal of Neuroscience Research</a>.'

      abstract:  'The Neocortex is a complex brain structure that represents the outside world, optimizes behavior, and provides associations based on prior learning. The Neocortex achieves these computations through flexible neural representations created by many cell types and mechanisms. Local inhibitory interneurons are leading contributors, acting through inhibition to shape excitatory activity. Parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PV) are the most numerous interneurons in Neocortex and exert powerful local control on signal relay by neighboring pyramidal cell ensembles. Despite intensive study, substantial debate exists as to how PV contribute to active processing, with opposing views regarding the value of their increased versus decreased activity. <br><br>In this thesis, I describe the discovery of two distinct PV cell ensembles that show increased and decreased activity that predicts success in sensory detection, a motif shared between Primary Somatosensory (SI) and Visual Neocortex (V1). Specifically, the “Hit” PV ensemble fires more on successfully perceived trials, while the “Miss” ensemble shows decreased activity. Our modeling suggests that Hit PV receive contextual signals that they translate into optimal signal relay and improved perception. Specifically, the model predicts that increased Hit PV firing suppresses Miss PV, in turn disinhibiting pyramidal neurons and amplifying sensory relay. Further, discoveries I made in V1 support the view that the Hit PV ensemble is key to contextual behavioral control. First, I found that Hit PV predominate in Layer II versus Layer III, consistent with enhanced top-down input. Second, I discovered a substantial population of non-sensory Hit PV, attuned to context and not the outside world, a feature not found amongst Miss PV.<br><br>To study PV selectively, I employed two-photon calcium imaging combined with a threshold-level sensory detection task. To selectively control activity in such genetically-defined cell classes, I helped develop a unique optogenetic-chemogenetic combined molecular control tool, Bioluminescent-Optogenetics (BL-OG). I further helped develop tools for photo-switching BL-OG efficacy ‘on’ with 2-photon light. This new tool should provide a direct method for selectively controlling specific, functionally-defined ensembles, such as those I discovered in V1.<br><br>These results demonstrate a common computational architecture exists among PV cells across Primary Sensory Neocortical areas, and show direct evidence for functional specialization of Layer II versus Layer III.'

      authors: ['Dmitrijs Celinskis'],
      abstract: 'Current state-of-the-art functional microscopy methods allow imaging of only the brain or spinal cord asynchronously. Yet understanding many biological processes such as the perception of noxious and innocuous stimuli, or diseases like chronic pain, likely emerge from combined dynamics in both foci, that can only be understood by their simultaneous measurement. In my dissertation work, I developed 3D printed universal brain-spinal cord implants to be used in combination with wearable miniscopes and benchtop two-photon microscopy, and specific surgical protocols required to implant them. This strategy allowed me to image neural and vascular dynamics in the brain and spinal cord of the same animals sequentially and simultaneously for up to 230 days post-implantation in the contexts of noxious and innocuous sensory behaviors. Further, <i>in vivo</i> fluorescent microscopy suffers from multiple limitations such as photon scattering noise, autofluorescence, photobleaching and phototoxicity. The photon scattering noise and, consequently, limited imaging depth are especially significant problems for spinal cord studies and the weight of miniature microscopes becomes a significant hurdle for imaging multiple parts of the body simultaneously. However, these issues can be mitigated via bioluminescence imaging.

      abstract: 'Despite ever improving treatment methods, there still is no way to effectively restore motor function after a severe spinal cord injury (SCI). A promising approach is to re-engage spinal cord neurons caudal to the injury site. A potential method to achieve this is optogenetics. However, the invasiveness and need for an implanted optical fiber severely limits the viability of this strategy for treating spinal cord injuries. In this study, a light-producing luciferase was used as an internal light source and was fused to a highly light-sensitive step function opsin (SFO, ChR2 (CS/DA). This genetically expressed construct can be activated following an intraperitoneal injection with coelenterazine (CTZ). When activated by the luciferase, the light-sensitive opsin opens, and the flow of cations results in the excitation of the neuron (BioLuminescent OptoGenetics, BL-OG). Rats were transduced with AAV expressing the excitatory sbGLuc-ChR2 CS/DA in the lumbar spinal cord. The human synapsin (hSyn) promotor allowed expression to be confined to neurons. Prior work has demonstrated that BL-OG activated by an injection of CTZ <i>via</i> an intraventricular cannula can improve hind limb motor function following SCI. In the present study, rats were treated with intraperitoneal injections (IPs) of CTZ or vehicle every other day for two weeks following a severe contusion SCI. Interestingly, animals receiving CTZ either had large functional improvements or suffered from chronic muscle spasticity. These findings indicate that the dose of CTZ used was likely too high. In the future, we plan to investigate the effects of changing the dose of CTZ.'

      abstract: 'In this study, we created a trans-synaptic, bioluminescent optogenetics approach to manipulate synaptically connected neurons. Neuronal communication mediates complex computations that underlie physiological and behavioral properties. Mapping of synaptic partners has been achieved through various methods, including GFP Reconstitution Across Synaptic Partners (GRASP). What is currently missing from the neuroscience toolkit is the ability to not only visualize but manipulate neurons that are synaptically connected. Bioluminescence-driven Optogenetics (BL-OG) is the method of harnessing a genetically encoded light source, a luciferase, to activate a light-sensing component, an opsin. In this study, BL-OG was used to create an “optical synapse” with a presynaptic light emitter and a postsynaptic light sensor to manipulate neuronal communication between synaptic partners. Various luciferase designs were tested for optimal bioluminescent emission for post-synaptic opsin activation. By utilizing an intercellular adhesion molecule, ICAM, as a scaffolding protein to help extend the light emitter across the synaptic cleft, excitatory and inhibitory opsins were able to be activated via multiple luciferases. The best performing construct developed was a bioluminescent resonance energy transfer (BRET) probe, NCS2, extended from the pre-synaptic terminal with ICAM. With the developed trans-synaptic tools, it is now possible to test specific neural circuitry <i>in vivo</i>.'

      abstract: 'Socially isolated mice exhibit behaviors of anxiety, depression, and social disorders. Although these behaviors are well documented, no coherent study has emerged describing the associated neurological changes that accompany these behaviors. Given that prefrontal cortex dysfunction results in behavioral abnormalities similar to those found in isolated mice, it is hypothesized that isolation during adolescence alters the development of this region. Using Thy-1-GFP mice, spine density and morphology was assessed, as well as electrophysiological activity and long-term potentiation. Results indicate an immaturity among dendritic spines among single housed animals, with dendritic spines appearing smaller and thinner. Single housed mice additionally show impaired plasticity through measures of long-term potentiation. Together these suggest an altered development and impairment of the prefrontal cortex of these animals.'

      authors:['Akash Pal'],
      abstract: 'BioLuminescent OptoGenetics (BL-OG) utilizes light emitted from a luciferase to activate optogenetic elements. When using a calcium-dependent luciferase, activation of the opsin becomes dependent on the activity state of the neuron expressing it: BioLuminescent Activity Dependent optogenetics (BLADe). To achieve this, we generated a bright, fast, bioluminescent calcium sensor by inserting the CaM-M13 peptide into a split slow burn <i>Gaussia</i> luciferase to generate lumicampsin, LMC. To date we have developed 6 working versions of LMC (LMC4-LMC8 and LMT) differing by their specific calcium binding sequences. Relative to natural and other engineered bioluminescent calcium reporters, LMC is significantly brighter and, most importantly, has faster peak kinetics; ideal properties for fast calcium reporting. To assess the possibility of BLADe, we co-transformed E18 rat cortical neurons with LMC4 and a plasmid encoding either the inhibitory opsin hGtARC2 or the excitatory opsin ChR2(C128S). Neurons were plated on multi-electrode arrays; most neurons expressed both LMC4 and opsin. In the presence of the luciferin coelenterazine (CTZ), influx of calcium will reconstitute the split luciferase and emit light that will open the cation or anion channel, affecting the neuron’s membrane polarization. Indeed, addition of CTZ to firing neurons resulted in decrease of spiking when LMC4 was co-transfected with an inhibitory opsin, and in increased spiking with an excitatory opsin. These effects of CTZ were not observed when opsins were expressed by themselves. This suggests that calcium-dependent light production from LMC4 can activate optogenetic elements.'

      abstract: 'The ability to manipulate specific neuronal populations of the spinal cord following spinal cord injury (SCI) could potentially prove highly beneficial for rehabilitation in patients through maintaining and strengthening still existing neuronal connections and/or facilitating the formation of new connections. A non-invasive and highly specific approach to neuronal stimulation is bioluminescent-optogenetics (BL-OG), where genetically expressed light emitting luciferases are tethered to light sensitive channelrhodopsins (luminopsins, LMO); neurons are activated by the addition of the luciferase substrate coelenterazine (CTZ).  This approach takes advantage of utilizing ion channels for current conduction while activating the channels through application of a small chemical compound, thus allowing non-invasive stimulation and recruitment of all targeted neurons. Rats were transduced in the lumbar spinal cord with AAV2/9 expressing the excitatory LMO3 under control of the human synapsin or the Homobox 9 promoter. A day after contusion injury of the thoracic spine, rats received either CTZ or vehicle every other day for 2 weeks. We found activation of either interneuron or motor neuron populations below the level of injury to significantly improve locomotor recovery. This is the first example of non-invasive activation of an optogenetic component as a potential therapy following spinal cord injury. Utilizing histological and gene expression methods to identify mechanisms underlying improvements it was determined that neuronal plasticity is the major driving force behind the functional recovery observed. These findings provide a foundation for a rational approach to spinal cord injury rehabilitation, thereby advancing approaches for functional recovery after SCI.'

    abstract:"Using neuroscientists&#39 tools of the trade one can image in independent animals either the brain or the spinal cord. Yet understanding many biological processes such as the perception of noxious and innocuous stimuli, or diseases like chronic pain, likely emerge from combined dynamics in both foci, that can only be understood by their simultaneous measurement. In this poster we report on multi-site surgical protocols and the designs of 3D printed universal brain-spinal cord implants that can be used in combination with wearable miniscopes and benchtop two-photon microscopy. This strategy allowed us to image neural and vascular dynamics in the brain and spinal cord of the same animals sequentially and simultaneously for up to 230 days post-implantation in the contexts of noxious and innocuous sensory behaviors. Further, <i>in vivo</i> fluorescent microscopy suffers from multiple limitations such as photon scattering noise, autofluorescence, photobleaching and phototoxicity. The photon scattering noise and, consequently, limited imaging depth are especially significant problems for spinal cord studies and the weight of miniature microscopes becomes a significant hurdle for imaging multiple parts of the body simultaneously. However, these issues can be mitigated via bioluminescence imaging. In pursuit of functional bioluminescent imaging in behaving animals, we demonstrate our ability to image bioluminescence <i>in vivo</i> using novel indicators and redesigned miniscopes (BLmini). Overall, present work offers a toolbox for imaging the brain and spinal cord in the same animal, and summarizes the progress towards next generation imaging tools using bioluminescence - innovations that can enable the optimal study of complex network dynamics from periphery-to-brain using fewer animals, reduced inter-animal variability and, otherwise impossible, synchronicity of data from brain and spinal cord. <br><a href='https://doi.org/10.26300/mk2y-2v89' class=bl-link target=_blank>View this poster in the Brown Digital Repository.</a>"

    abstract: "In neurodevelopmental disorders, neural activity is altered within the developing neocortical network. We previously showed that enhanced pyramidal firing during development, in the otherwise normal mouse neocortex, can selectively alter adult circuit function and produce maladaptive changes in behavior. We systematically enhanced pan-neocortical pyramidal activity levels during the early postnatal development of healthy mice using non-invasive BioLuminescent-OptoGenetic (BL-OG)-mediated activation of luminopsin 3 (LMO3) expressing neurons. Developmental hyperexcitation of Emx1-positive pyramidal neurons during postnatal days 4 - 14 led to decreased social interaction and increased grooming activity in adult animals, both of which are key symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). <i>In vivo</i>, both prefrontal neural activity and functional markers of cortico-striatal connectivity were impaired in developmentally hyperexcited adult Emx1-LMO3-positive mice, and <i>ex vivo</i> slice recordings revealed alterations to both intrinsic excitability and synaptic E/I ratio in L5 prefrontal cortex pyramidal neurons. We now want to further dissect the neural populations and their specific target areas mediating the observed behavioral and electrophysiological changes. Pyramidal neurons are distributed across all layers of the cerebral cortex with the exception of layer 1, and those in each layer are distinguished by their patterns of long-range axonal projections. Those in layer 5 integrate information between cortical areas but also project to subcortical structures involved in the generation of behavior. We carried out developmental hyperexcitation in Rbp4-LMO3 mice, thus restricting LMO3 expression to L5 projection neurons. The behavioral and electrophysiological consequences were compared to those of pan-laminar neocortical developmental hyperexcitation."

      abstract: 'Disturbing spontaneous neural activity during developmental processes through genetic or environmental causes is linked to altered adult behavior in neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorders. However, it is difficult to identify a link to specific cell types due to the complexity of underlying etiological susceptibilities. To experimentally address the question of whether early life alterations in neural activity can induce permanent behavioral phenotypes and related circuit changes, we systematically and selectively enhanced pan-neocortical Emx1+ pyramidal activity levels during early postnatal development. We have previously found that early hyperexcitation of pyramidal neurons alone, and for a limited time window, is sufficient to create adult neurophysiological and behavioral signatures of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) phenotypes in the absence of other insults (e.g. genetic or environmental). The observed changes replicated those seen in other models of ASD and in ASD patients: social deficits, stereotypic movements, hyperexcitable pyramidal neurons, and deficits in inhibitory neuron function. Our prior <i>in vivo</i> electrophysiology studies showed changes in the prefrontal cortex, a target motivated by our observed behavioral deficits in social interaction. However, several studies suggest that primary sensory neocortex may also be transformed by this manipulation. We are systematically testing the parallel hypothesis that sensory hypersensitivity and related electrophysiological changes occur in our established experimental model. To this end, we are testing the key prediction that increasing activity of pyramidal neurons during early postnatal development leads to persistent alterations in firing properties of inhibitory fast spiking interneurons (FS), and deficits in sensory processing in adults. We are conducting simultaneous <i>in vivo</i> electrophysiology recordings in mouse vibrissa somatosensory cortex (vSI) while presenting fixed-frequency vibrissa stimuli at varying amplitudes as a probe to relate neocortical dynamics with sensory processing. Our results further dissect basic mechanisms of neocortical sensory processing and conceptually broaden discussions of ASD pathophysiology by considering developmental neural hyperexcitation as a convergent driver across etiologies of ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders.'

      abstract: 'Fluorescent proteins (FPs) have been a part of the biological imaging toolbox for nearly 30 years, and while light microscope technology continues to advance to allow imaging of living systems at increasingly higher time and spatial resolution, the FPs used in this imaging have not advanced at the same pace. At the same time, the majority of biological imaging is still performed on “traditional” widefield and laser scanning confocal microscopes, while FP development efforts have largely focused on generating probes for advanced techniques such as single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). Properties critical to long-term imaging of living cells, such as photostability and behavior in fusions with other proteins have been slow to improve. To address the shortfall in development of improved FPs for both general and advanced uses, we have engineered green- and yellow-emitting monomeric variants of the ultra-bright dimeric FP AausFP1 and a red-emitting monomeric derivative of mCherry with much higher brightness than its parent. All of these new FP variants appear to be very inert when fused to other proteins and are highly photostable under both widefield and scanning laser illumination. We anticipate that these FPs will enable more sensitive detection of signal with lower illumination power, allowing researchers to observe cells expressing lower amounts of fusion protein for more biologically authentic behavior.'

      abstract: 'Oscillatory brain dynamics are correlated with many different cognitive functions. Additionally, many disorders of the nervous system are correlated with alterations in these dynamics. Understanding which brain structures, and which neuron subtypes, coordinate these dynamics holds the potential to link the rich non-invasive correlation-based data on oscillatory brain dynamics with concrete mechanisms. Further, correlational oscillatory biomarkers of nervous system disorders can be evaluated through the lens of concrete pathology. However, a detailed, mechanistic understanding of oscillatory brain dynamics remains incomplete. Prior research has implicated thalamocortical interactions as a source of oscillatory dynamics, and a parallel body of research has implicated ‘higher-order’ thalamic nuclei, such as the pulvinar in humans and primates and the posterior medial nucleus (POm) in rodents, in contextual modulation of cortical sensory processing. We present here preliminary evidence that bursting in POm precedes oscillatory "Beta Events," discrete triphasic signals (15-29 Hz). The anatomical projection pattern of POm to primary somatosensory neocortex (SI) aligns well with our detailed computational model predictions as to the laminar origins of beta-events. Further, burst spike firing, common in thalamus, is an ideal driver in this model. POm also targets a diverse array of areas, all of which express Beta Events, and prior studies have shown enhanced beta-band power with optogenetic POm drive. We recently introduced a bioluminescent ‘all-optical synapse’, in which light emitting bioluminescent molecules are released from presynaptic terminals and activate opsins expressed on virally targeted postsynaptic partners. We demonstrated that Cre-mediated expression of the excitatory opsin ChR2(C128S) in parvalbumin positive cells in SI postsynaptic to virally targeted bioluminescent thalamocortical excitatory cells was sufficient to drive increases in gamma band (30-100 Hz) oscillations in SI. We present new data here in which POm is exclusively targeted as the bioluminescent presynaptic element in VGAT-ChR2 transgenic mice in which all GABAergic neurons express the excitatory opsin. This arrangement produced a distinct increase in delta oscillations (1-5 Hz) as recorded in SI, suggesting that excitatory POm projections to different neural subpopulations in cortex are able to drive different oscillatory motifs in cortex. Further, initial studies combining 1-Photon imaging of POm axon activity with electrophysiology, and multi-site recordings, support the view that POm activity precedes Beta Events.'

      abstract:'BioLuminescent OptoGenetics (“BL-OG”) is a chemogenetic method that enables optogenetic reactions without the use of an external light device. In BL-OG, a photo-enzyme (e.g., slow-burn Gaussia Luciferase; sbGLuc) is tethered to an optogenetic element (e.g., Volvox-Channelrhodopsin-1; VCHR1) that is activated via bioluminescent light. Bioluminescence is generated by injecting a chemical substrate (luciferin, e.g., Coelenterazine; CTZ) that is catalyzed by the photo-enzyme neighboring the opsin. In a previous study, we showed proportional increases in neural firing and bioluminescence in response to higher doses of CTZ. However, these BL-OG effects were observed during invasive injections of the luciferin directly into the brain. Thus, to demonstrate that BL-OG is a viable method for modulating neural activity non-invasively, it is key to determine dose response curves when the substrate is injected systemically. Here, we injected different dosages of h-CTZ via the tail vein of mice expressing the BL-OG construct LMO7, a novel and more photo-efficient BRET-based molecule that tethers the bioluminescent and fluorescent protein NCS2 to VCHR1. Bioluminescence was imaged using an EMCCD camera while animals ran on a wheel, and were injected with six different concentration dosages of h-CTZ. Data reveal systematic increases in bioluminescence in response to larger dosages of h-CTZ. These bioluminescent responses were observed through a thinned-skull preparation (i.e., without the need of implanting a cranial window), highlighting the photo efficiency of the LMO7 construct. Our study furthers our understanding of the BL-OG technique by providing a map between BL-OG effects and systemic injections of h-CTZ via the tail vein, and shows that thin skull technique can be used as a less invasive window for bioluminescence imaging studies.'

Recent developments are opsins with increased light sensitivity, red-shifted activation wavelength, as well as GPCR-based opsins.

We took advantage of the progress in this field to expand our bioluminescent optogenetics (BL-OG) platform. Here, light-sensing molecules are activated by light emitted from a luciferase enzyme when it oxidizes a small molecule luciferin. The luciferase is usually fused to the opsin in a luminopsin, LMO. BL-OG enables both direct activation of the opsin using an LED for temporally precise control and chemogenetic manipulation of neuronal populations distributed throughout the brain via systemic administration of the luciferin, using the same genetic construct in the same animal. To expand the utility of BL-OG, we generated a series of luciferase-opsin fusion proteins that employ recently improved opsins. The fusion proteins were expressed in primary cultured neurons and assessed for their effects on activating and silencing neurons in multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) and in patch recordings.

      abstract:'In BioLuminescent OptoGenetics, a genetically encoded light source, a luciferase, activates a light-sensing optogenetic element, a channelrhodopsin or a pump. Here, we leveraged this coupling strategy and developed a tool platform, Interluminescence, for experimental control of synaptic transmission between genetically defined neuronal partners by creating an optical synapse. "Interluminescence" means "bioluminescent light in between," here between a sender cell and a receiver cell. When the sender is a presynaptic neuron expressing luciferase and the receiver is its postsynaptic partner expressing opsin, we essentially create an optical synapse. Upon administration of the luciferase substrate, luciferin, bioluminescence emitted from a presynaptic neuron activates light-sensing opsins in a postsynaptic neuron. We previously demonstrated the effects of Interluminescence electrophysiologically at postsynaptic population level both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Here we tested Interluminescence by patch clamp recordings from individual postsynaptic neurons. We tested two different scenarios of optical synapse. First, when the presynaptic neuron expresses luciferase targeted to synaptic vesicles and second, when luciferase is tethered to the presynaptic membrane. The availability of luciferase in the former is dependent on presynaptic activity while the latter has persistent presence of luciferase in the cleft regardless of presynaptic activity. To test these conditions, rat cortex and striatum neurons were nucleofected with a luciferase-dTomato construct and an excitatory opsin-EYFP construct respectively, and were plated on glass coverslips as mixed culture. Synaptic pairs were located by visualizing the reporter expression for the luciferase (dTomato) on presynaptic cortical neurons and for the opsin (EYFP) on postsynaptic striatal neurons at the time of patch. Whole cell patch configuration was achieved on the opsin-expressing postsynaptic neurons and activity was recorded in continuous current clamp mode. Depolarization in postsynaptic neurons was robustly elicited with bioluminescence from presynaptic partners in the presence of synaptic blockers, and was likely due to trans-synaptic communication independent of traditional neurotransmission. We observed significant differences between traditional neurotransmission-induced versus Interluminescence-induced postsynaptic action potentials. The information gained about optical synapses at single neuron level with different luciferase and opsin combinations will be insightful in planning circuit-specific <i>in vivo</i> experiments.'

      abstract:'Chemogenetic modulation of neural populations exerts selective control over cells engineered to express an exogenous receptor that responds selectively to a small molecule. Chemogenetic approaches have steadily gained use for studies requiring circuit-wide manipulation over longer periods of time in behaving experimental animals. There are several chemogenetic platforms for manipulating neural activity. These are built from either ligand gated ion channels (i.e. PSAMs, pharmacologically selective actuator modules) or G-protein coupled receptors (i.e. DREADDs, designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs). An orthogonal chemogenetic approach is BL-OG (BioLuminescent-OptoGenetics), where an opsin is activated by bioluminescent light emitted from a tethered luciferase (luminopsin, LMO); light emission occurs only in the presence of a luciferin that is oxidized by the luciferase enzyme. While in both acute and long-term treatments the effects of chemogenetic activation of neurons on animal behavior are well documented, information is lacking on the molecular, cellular, and functional effects of chemogenetic stimulation technologies on the neurons expressing the actuators. We initiated <i>in vitro</i> studies designed to gain insight into how chemogenetic stimulation affects neurons by characterizing their electrophysiological attributes, their morphological features, and their transcriptome signatures. We cultured primary rat cortical neurons on multi electrode arrays (MEAs) for electrophysiological recordings, on 24 well plates for morphological analysis, and on 12 well plates for collection of RNA. Mature cultures of neurons expressing three representative chemogenetic actuators, hM3Dq, PSAM4-5HT3 and LMO7 or a control plasmid (EYFP), were stimulated once daily over 5 days with their respective effectors (CNO, PSEM, CTZ, or vehicle). The data showed differences between chemogenetic platforms in how the neurons, after repeated stimulation, reacted to excitation, the degree of their dendritic arborization, and the quantity and quality of transcriptome changes. This information on how chemogenetic stimulation affects cells is important because the causality between neural activity and behavior remains obscured without knowledge about effects of stimulation modalities on genetic repertoire, morphology, and/or electrophysiological properties of neurons. Identification of key parameters significantly altered through chemogenetic stimulation will guide interpretation of past and future chemogenetic experiments and will be instructive for users and toolbuilders of chemogenetic platforms.'

      abstract:"Patterns of neuronal activity during early development are believed to guide the assembly of neural circuits. Thus, alterations of neuronal activity in this time window may cause structural and functional changes that persist into adulthood. Specific alterations may lead to unique patterns of aberrant circuit formation, a mechanism which has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism. Findings from human and animal studies suggest that multiple etiologically distinct forms of autism alter the physiology of specific deep-layer (layer V) prefrontal cortical neurons that project to subcortical targets. These neural populations play an important role in both normal and abnormal social behavior. To probe a potential functional link between development of cortical circuitry and adult behavior, we hyperexcited layer V cortical neurons during early postnatal development and assessed the effects on adult behavior. Mice conditionally expressing the excitatory luciferase-opsin fusion LMO3 (sbGluc fused to VChR1) were crossed with Rbp4-Cre mice, enabling LMO3 expression in layer V pyramidal neurons in offspring carrying both alleles. The luciferin coelenterazine (CTZ) was delivered to all pups in the litter intraperitoneally once per day during post-natal days 4-14. In presence of CTZ, light emission from sbGluc drives activation of VChR1 to depolarize the cell and evoke action potentials in Rbp4-LMO3 pups. Starting at postnatal day 60, we examined the behavior of all mice across several testing paradigms, including open field, water T maze, sociability, novel object, and rotarod. Where applicable and to standardize our quantification of behavioral data we implemented DeepLabCut, an open-source machine learning tool that leverages recent advances in computer vision to allow accurate, markerless tracking of animals across behavior testing videos. <br><a href='https://doi.org/10.26300/ykav-7668' class=bl-link target=_blank>View this poster in the Brown Digital Repository.</a>"

      abstract:"To understand how groups of neurons participate in neural circuits underlying behavior, technologies are needed for observing and controlling the ensembles employed during behavior across the brain. We are developing a platform technology for optical genetic activation using bioluminescence. In this system, light emitted from a luciferase in the presence of its substrate, luciferin, acts as the light source to drive light-sensing transcription factors. By using a Ca2+ dependent split luciferase we can take advantage of the unique possibility to make light emission itself dependent on neuronal activity. This technology allows acute capture of activated cells during a behavior across layers and brain regions and manipulation of these same cells experimentally by activity-driven transcription of actuator molecules. The precise temporal window of optical genetic activation is experimenter-controlled through the application of luciferin.<br><br>For this platform to work optimally it is critical to use photosensing transcription factors with high light sensitivity and robust signal-to-noise ratios. We initially explored bioluminescent activation in four distinct systems: FKF1/GI, EL222, GAVPO, and CRY2/CIB. Using NanoLuc luciferase (NLuc) for blue light emission, we found all four to be equally efficient in bioluminescence-induced transcription of the reporter protein Firefly Luciferase (FLuc) in HEK293 cells.<br><br>EL222 was chosen for further optimization because it is a single component factor and is also a relatively small molecule. To improve its sensitivity to light and decrease its basal activity levels, we are molecularly evolving wildtype EL222. We first used rational design, employing a multiple sequence alignment created via the software MUSCLE, to facilitate the identification of regions of functional significance across the protein using the program ConSurf. This design produced 97 EL222 variants that each contain a single amino acid change. All variants will be cloned using site-directed mutagenesis. The mutants will be screened by LED stimulation of transiently transfected HEK293 cells harboring the EL222 specific promoter 5xC120 driving the FLuc reporter gene. The best candidates identified in this screen will undergo repeated cycles of random mutagenesis and screening to further improve the transcription factor.<br><br>Transcription factor-based systems are advantageous because unlike chemical inducers of gene expression, transcription factors do not diffuse freely away from target regions. In addition to location specificity, transcription factors allow precise switching of genes from off to on in a timeframe that cannot realistically be achieved by chemical induction. The incorporation of transcription factors controlled by light not only increases the spatiotemporal resolution of gene activation but also applies an inducer (i.e. blue light) that is nontoxic, easy to acquire, and extremely tunable. Further improvement of EL222 will better these desirable characteristics of light controlled gene expression and make this transcription factor optimally inducible by bioluminescence. <br><a href='https://doi.org/10.26300/fknn-ww44' class=bl-link target=_blank>View this poster in the Brown Digital Repository.</a>"

      abstract:"In BioLuminescent OptoGenetics, a genetically encoded light source, a luciferase, activates a light-sensing optogenetic element, a channelrhodopsin or a pump. Here, we leveraged this coupling strategy and developed a tool platform, Interluminescence, for experimental control of synaptic transmission between genetically defined neuronal partners by creating an optical synapse. ‘Interluminescence’ means ‘bioluminescent light in between’, here between a sender cell and a receiver cell. When the sender is a presynaptic neuron expressing luciferase and the receiver is its postsynaptic partner expressing opsin, we essentially create an optical synapse. Upon administration of the luciferase substrate, luciferin, bioluminescence emitted from a presynaptic neuron activates light-sensing opsins in a postsynaptic neuron. We previously demonstrated the effects of Interluminescence electrophysiologically at postsynaptic population level both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Here we tested Interluminescence by patch clamp recordings from individual postsynaptic neurons. We tested two different scenarios of optical synapse. First, when the presynaptic neuron expresses luciferase targeted to synaptic vesicles and second, when luciferase is tethered to the presynaptic membrane. The availability of luciferase in the former is dependent on presynaptic activity while the latter has persistent presence of luciferase in the cleft regardless of presynaptic activity. To test these conditions, rat cortex and striatum neurons were nucleofected with a luciferase-dTomato construct and an excitatory opsin-EYFP construct respectively, and were plated on glass coverslips as mixed culture. Synaptic pairs were located by visualizing the reporter expression for the luciferase (dTomato) on presynaptic cortical neurons and for the opsin (EYFP) on postsynaptic striatal neurons at the time of patch. Whole cell patch configuration was achieved on the opsin-expressing postsynaptic neurons and activity was recorded in continuous current clamp mode. Depolarization in postsynaptic neurons was robustly elicited with bioluminescence from presynaptic partners in the presence of synaptic blockers, and was likely due to trans-synaptic communication independent of traditional neurotransmission. We observed significant differences between traditional neurotransmission-induced versus Interluminescence-induced postsynaptic action potentials. The information gained about optical synapses at single neuron level with different luciferase and opsin combinations will be insightful in planning circuit-specific <i>in vivo</i> experiments.<br><a href='https://doi.org/10.26300/nfaq-hg35' class=bl-link target=_blank>View this poster in the Brown Digital Repository.</a>"

      abstract: "Chemogenetic modulation of neuronal populations allows for precise control over cells engineered to express an exogenous receptor that responds exclusively to specific molecules. Chemogenetic approaches have steadily gained use for behavioral studies with experimental animals requiring circuit-wide manipulation over longer periods of times. There are several chemogenetic platforms for manipulating neuronal activity that are built from either ligand-gated ion channels (i.e., PSAMs, pharmacologically selective actuator modules) or G-protein coupled receptors (i.e., DREADDs, designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs). An orthogonal chemogenetic approach is BL-OG (BioLuminescent-OptoGenetics), where an opsin is activated by bioluminescent light emitted from a tethered luciferase (luminopsin, LMO); light emission occurs only in the presence of a luciferin oxidized by the enzyme luciferase. While the effects of chemogenetic activation of neurons on animal behavior in both acute and long-term treatments is well documented, information is lacking on the cellular and functional effects of chemogenetic stimulation technologies on the neurons expressing the actuators. We initiated <i>in vitro</i> studies designed to gain insight into how chemogenetic stimulation affects neurons by characterizing their electrophysiological attributes and their morphological features. Primary rat cortical neurons were cultured on multi electrode arrays (MEAs) and on coverslips in 24 well plates. These neurons were transduced with viral vectors each containing an excitatory chemogenetic actuator (hM3Dq, PSAM4-5HT3, and LMO7) or a control plasmid (EYFP). Cultures of mature neurons were stimulated once daily over 5 days with their respective effectors (CNO, PSEM, CTZ, or vehicle). Control cultures either expressed the actuator and were exposed to 5 days of vehicle treatment, or neurons did not express the actuator and were exposed to 5 days of effector treatment. MEA recordings before and after acute electrical stimulation revealed that chemogenetically stimulated neurons have decreased excitability compared to vehicle treated cultures. The extent of arborization and dendritic branching was assessed by Sholl analysis to determine if chronic chemogenetic stimulation altered neuronal morphology. The data showed differences between chemogenetic platforms in the degree of their dendritic arborization. This information on how chemogenetic stimulation affects cells is important because the causality between neuronal activity and behavior remains obscured without knowledge about the effects of stimulation modalities on inherent neuron properties. Identification of key parameters significantly altered through chemogenetic stimulation will guide interpretation of past and future chemogenetic experiments and will be instructive for users and tool builders of chemogenetic platforms.<br><a href='https://doi.org/10.26300/c8am-c248' class=bl-link target=_blank>View this poster in the Brown Digital Repository.</a>"

By investigating alterations in circuitry though hyperexcitation in the developing brain, adult behavior can be assessed for phenotypic examples of psychiatric disorders. To test the impact of hyperexcitation of neuronal circuitry during early postnatal development, we took advantage of Bioluminescent Optogenetics (BL-OG), where light stimulation of an optogenetic element is achieved either through bioluminescence emitted from a tethered luciferase upon application of a chemical substrate or through physical light via fiber optics. Mice conditionally expressing LMO3, a fusion of sbGluc luciferase and the blue light sensing opsin VChR1, were crossed with Emx1-Cre transgenic mice, thus limiting expression of LMO3 to cortical pyramidal neurons. Overexcitation of developing pyramidal neurons was achieved chemogenetically by administering the luciferase substrate coelenterazine intraperitoneally during postnatal days 4-14. During adulthood, <i>in vivo</i> extracellular recordings of neocortical circuits revealed functional deficits in excitability, both in spontaneous firing rates and in response to temporally precise LED stimulation. Additionally, alterations in excitatory and inhibitory balance were seen. Here we analyzed the spike dynamics of neurons using single-unit activity with high temporal resolution. Using high temporal resolutions allow us to dive deeper into our understanding of these neurons and this understanding will help us to find strong correlation and/or causation factors.<br><a href='https://doi.org/10.26300/6ds7-hq64' class=bl-link target=_blank>View this poster in the Brown Digital Repository.</a>"

Neuronal processes originating from both populations crossed the gap separating them, forming synaptic contacts between the two populations. Bioluminescence emission by cortical neurons generated with application of CTZ was used to drive striatal neurons across synapses.

Going forward, I will investigate and manipulate cell-cell communication, including re-establishing desirable, and eliminating undesirable, inter-cellular communication under various pathologic conditions.

    abstract:'A wealth of new tools can directly control output of specific neurons on fast (e.g., optogenetic) or sustained (e.g., chemogenetic) time scales. In contrast, almost no methods exist for selectively modulating communication between defined cells at the synaptic level, which is key to understanding how functional connectivity creates percepts, engrams and actions. Here, we advance a novel strategy for selectively modulating synaptic transmission, Interluminescence. This approach uses bioluminescent light from a presynaptic axon terminal, generated by a luciferase, to modulate an opsin in its postsynaptic target under experimenter-controlled introduction of a small molecule (luciferin). We developed two separate methods that target the luciferase to the synaptic cleft. To provide sustained and synapse-specific regulation, the ‘Persist-Int’ strategy places a luciferase in the synaptic cleft tethered to the presynaptic terminal, and an opsin in the opposing postsynaptic membrane. In this configuration, light generation creates sustained and activity-independent modulation. In the complementary ‘Act-Int’ strategy, luciferase is released into the synaptic cleft in response to presynaptic activity, a synapse-specific form of activity-dependent modulation. During the first year of this project we gathered robust proof-of-principle data for the Act-Int strategy by demonstrating Interluminescence activation and inhibition of synaptically connected neurons. We showed that Interluminescence requires synaptic connectivity, depends on active firing of and synaptic vesicle release from the presynaptic neuron, and that postsynaptic effects are mediated by the opsin. Importantly, we provided evidence that Interluminescence can change network dynamics <i>in vivo</i> by robustly driving broad-band gamma oscillations. We are now characterizing in detail the impact of Interluminescence in individual neurons by patch clamp recordings in primary neurons and brain slices, examining the impact of interluminescence <i>in vivo</i> in anesthetized and awake animals, and are elaborating this platform technology by testing novel luciferase – opsin combinations, and by engineering powerful new light emitting components to further increase the temporal and spatial resolution of Interluminescence.'

      abstract:'Current opto- and chemogenetic tools generically modify cellular excitability, or require gene expression to target specific synaptic junctions. The ability to selectively regulate the impact of afferents on a specific subset of their synaptic targets, and only when these afferents are active, would be a powerful asset to understanding dynamic neural circuits. Here we present a bioluminescent optogenetic tool that provides a high degree of synaptic selectivity and is capable of regulating circuits based on their intrinsic activity. This intersectional dynamic goal is achieved by packaging bioluminescent enzymes in dense core vesicles within presynaptic neurons and expressing optogenetic channels on their postsynaptic targets. When the bioluminescent substrate coelenterazine (CTZ) is introduced, bioluminescent light is generated at synaptic clefts that recently released enzyme, activating the optogenetic channels in neurons postsynaptic to a presynaptically-active input. Our group has tested this molecular tool extensively <i>in vitro</i>. Here we present data employing this molecule <i>in vivo</i> in the anesthetized mouse. We targeted thalamocortical synaptic projections of the mouse vibrissal system from the posterior medial and ventral posteromedial (VPM) thalamic nuclei onto parvalbumin positive (PV) neurons in primary somatosensory cortex (SI). Thalamic neurons were virally targeted to express bioluminescent enzymes in dense core vesicles. In mice receiving vibrissal stimulation, application of CTZ directly onto the cortical surface of SI elicited strong bioluminescent light output, indicating that thalamic neurons were indeed releasing bioluminescent enzymes at their axonal terminals in SI. Next, we recorded laminar multi-unit activity in SI before and after application of CTZ to the SI surface. Upon CTZ administration and emission of bioluminescent light, a marked increase in multiunit firing was observed spanning a wide swath of SI laminae. In a second cohort of animals we virally targeted only VPM, which projects densely to PV cells in deeper layers while avoiding those in superficial layers. In this cohort of animals we observed a laminar shift to the middle layers of bioluminescence driven MUA activity in agreement with VPM termination patterns. These data provide strong preliminary evidence that a synapse- and activity-dependent optogenetic construct driven by bioluminescent light is a viable and potentially powerful tool for dynamic neural circuit dissection.'

      abstract:'Experimental manipulation of neural activity in genetically defined populations is currently largely centered around optogenetic or chemogenetic techniques, each featuring unique strengths and limitations. To increase user flexibility, and facilitate designs where advantages of each above approach can be leveraged at distinct experimental stages, we have developed bioluminescent optogenetics (BL-OG) which provides combined opto- and chemogenetic control in a single molecule (a luminopsin, or LMO). The LMO features a bioluminescent light emitter fused to an optogenetic actuator, enabling both direct activation of the opsin using an LED (for temporally precise control) and chemogenetic manipulation of neuronal populations distributed throughout the brain via systemic administration of the bioluminescent substrate coelenterazine (CTZ). To expand the utility of BL-OG, we here sought to further increase the efficacy of chemogenetic (bioluminescent) activation of LMOs. Through engineering of novel Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based bioluminescent emitters featuring superior brightness and emission spectra matched to Volvox channelrhodopsin 1 (VChR1), we develop and thoroughly benchmark a new excitatory LMO (LMO7) that will improve the efficacy of chemogenetic activation in targeted neuronal populations.'

        abstract:'Genetically encoded optical sensors and advancements in microscopy instrumentation and techniques have revolutionized the scientific toolbox available for probing complex biological processes such as release of specific neurotransmitters. Most genetically encoded optical sensors currently used are based on fluorescence and have been highly successful tools for single-cell imaging in superficial brain regions. However, there remains a need to develop new tools for reporting neuronal activity <i>in vivo</i> within deeper structures without the need for hardware such as lenses or fibers to be implanted within the brain. Our approach to this problem is to replace the fluorescent elements of the existing biosensors with bioluminescent elements. This eliminates the need of external light sources to illuminate the sensor and overcomes several drawbacks of fluorescence imaging such as limited light penetration depth, excitation scattering, and tissue heating that are all associated with the external light needed for fluorescence imaging.We have bioengineered the first genetically encoded bioluminescent neurotransmitter indicators using a multistep screening approach. First rational design using a variety of split luciferases and linker variants to fuse the luciferases to a sensing protein. Then an automated workflow to screen for improved variants in mammalian cells, using automation for mini preps and transfection of mammalian cell cultures. As a result, we created a BioLuminescent Indicator of the Neurotransmitter Glutamate (BLING). Using our protein evolution approach in mammalian cells, we were able to improve our BLINGs response by 2.5x. Our improved glutamate indicator demonstrated a 255% +/-50 increase in response to neurotransmitter presentation when expressed in mammalian cells, can report changes in extracellular glutamate when used in a plate reader and outperforms various fluorescent sensors in plate reader assays. Finally, to test the feasibility of imaging BLING we used real-time microscopy which demonstrated up to a 310% increase in light emission detectable at the single cell level. We expect this new approach to neurotransmitter indicator design to enable the engineering of bioluminescent probes for multiple additional neurotransmitters, ultimately allowing neuroscientists to monitor activity associated with a specific neurotransmitter as it relates to behavior in a variety of psychiatric disorders, among many other applications.'

        abstract:'Calcium is the ubiquitous cellular second messenger and calcium signals are proxy for biologically significant events including neuronal action potentials. Genetically encoded fluorescent calcium sensors are well established tools in neuroscience, but they have a number of limitations for use in biological tissue, such as tissue heating from illumination, other off-target biological effects of high-intensity excitation, and scattering of excitation light that confines imaging to small volumes of the brain. Previous generations of bioluminescent calcium indicators have insufficient brightness and relatively small calcium-dependent changes in signal magnitudes, and these properties have limited their widespread adoption in the neuroscience research community. Here, we present “Calcium BioLuminescence-Activity Meters” (CaBLAMs), a family of bioluminescent calcium indicators engineered from a novel luciferase and calcium sensor domain topology. By optimizing each component of these indicators, including the luciferase domain, split site, calmodulin and RS20 peptide, and linker length and composition, we have achieved extremely low baseline emission at cytosolic resting calcium concentrations, a high Hill coefficient, and a very high signal change (delta-L/L) at physiologically relevant elevated cytosolic calcium concentrations. Further optimization of the luciferin (substrate) used for imaging the CaBLAMs generates signals large enough to observe glutamate-induced calcium events originating in dendrites and propagating to the soma in individual neurons <i>ex vivo</i>. These new sensors have the potential to enable imaging of calcium activity in deep brain regions in behaving mice for the first time without the need for an excitation light source.'

        abstract:'Many psychiatric disorders are thought to have neurodevelopmental origins, stemming from malformation of neural circuits in early development. Early disruptions to cortical activity may underlie the later manifestation of behavioral changes typical of disorders such as autism. We carried out unbiased testing of the role of developmental over-excitation in altering adult behavior and circuit dynamics. We took advantage of Bioluminescent Optogenetics (BL-OG), where light stimulation of an optogenetic element is achieved either through bioluminescence emitted from a tethered luciferase upon application of a chemical substrate or through application of physical light via fiber optics. Mice conditionally expressing LMO3, a fusion of sbGLuc and VChR1, were crossed with Emx1-Cre transgenic mice, thus limiting expression of LMO3 to cortical pyramidal neurons. By delivering the luciferin CTZ intraperitoneally during post-natal days 4-14, over-excitation was induced chemogenetically in the cortical pyramidal neurons of developing mouse pups. During adulthood, mice were tested behaviorally, assessed for electrophysiological changes in circuit dynamics by standard optogenetic interrogation, and probed for changes in interneuron numbers. While Emx1-positive neurons were hyperexcited during postnatal development across the cortex, behavioral, electrophysiological, and morphological effects manifested differently in distinct areas.'

        abstract:'Optical imaging is a transformative tool for neuroscience, enabling the elucidation of biological circuits that generate behavior. State-of-the-art imaging tools rely on a restrained preparation, limiting natural behavior while measuring cellular activity via fluorescence (FL). Recently, advances in wearable miniature microscopy expanded the range of accessible behaviors by allowing imaging in freely behaving animals. However, miniature microscopes (miniscopes) are currently used for brain imaging using FL. Miniscopes have not been adopted for imaging bioluminescence (BL) and/or other parts of the body. However, unfavorable attributes of FL indicators constrain the extent of imaging experiments. These attributes include photobleaching, autofluorescence and excitation light scattering noise, especially in the parts of the body like the spinal cord due to myelination. All 3 issues can be eliminated, and an increase in imaging depth achieved, by using BL instead of the FL. BL does not require an external light source and offers a lower biological noise floor, often creating higher signal-to-noise ratio. However, the overall lower BL light intensity presents a challenge for imaging using low-cost low-sensitivity miniscopes. The objective of our work is to improve the quality of cortical and spinal imaging using BL and miniature microscopy tools. To this end, we (i) present an expansion of the miniscope use towards neurovascular imaging in the spinal cord. Spinal neurovascular imaging is accomplished by integrating a custom 3D-printed vertebral implant with miniscope hardware that ensures mechanical and optical stability over time up to 5 months post-implantation. Such implants allow interchangeable imaging of the brain or spinal cord in free or restrained mice. (ii) We demonstrate our ability of imaging BL calcium indicators using EM-CCD camera at rates up to 2 frames-per-second (FPS) through a cranial window in behaving animals following the systemic administration of BL substrate (luciferase), and as fast as 10 FPS with the topical administration of luciferase. With intracortical administration of luciferase BL calcium signals can be imaged using redesigned FL miniscopes (the "BLmini") at rates as fast as 5 FPS (Celinskis et al., 2020). Altogether, our work presents significant progress towards BL calcium imaging with experimenter-friendly peripheral routes of substrate administration using low-cost wearable miniature microscopes across multiple sites throughout the nervous system.'

        abstract: 'In BioLuminescent OptoGenetics (BL-OG) a genetically encoded light source, a luciferase, activates a light-sensing optogenetic element, a channelrhodopsin or a pump. When light emitter and light sensor are tethered, as in luciferase-opsin fusion proteins (luminopsins, LMO), application of the luciferin coelenterazine (CTZ) and subsequent light production will change the membrane potential of the cell expressing the LMO. Here, we leverage this coupling strategy across the synapse by placing the luciferase in the presynaptic neuron and the opsin in the postsynaptic neuron. In the presence of CTZ, light emitted from the luciferase activates the opsin of synaptically connected neurons. We previously demonstrated the effects of this ‘Interluminescence’ on synapse-specific circuit control in multi electrode array recordings of cortical and striatal neuron co-cultures. Here we tested BL-OG effects across the synapse by patch clamp recordings from individual postsynaptic neurons. E18 rat cortex and striatum neurons were nucleofected with a luciferase-dTomato construct and an excitatory opsin-EYFP construct, respectively, and were plated on glass coverslips as a mixed culture. At DIVs 28-40, synaptic pairs were located by visualizing the reporter expression for the luciferase (red) on presynaptic cortical neurons and for the opsin (yellow) on postsynaptic striatal neurons. Whole cell patch configuration was achieved on the opsin-expressing postsynaptic neuron and synapse-specific modulation of the postsynaptic neuron was recorded in current clamp mode. Generation of action potentials was compared in the presence of CTZ and vehicle. Depolarization in postsynaptic neurons was robustly elicited with bioluminescence from presynaptic partners and was likely due to trans-synaptic communication. Such biological light activation across genetically determined synaptic partners offers the potential to optogenetically dissect synaptic communication non-invasively.'

        abstract:'BioLuminescent-OptoGenetics (BL-OG) is a combined strategy that allows chemogenetic and/or optogenetic cellular manipulation and regulation. Luminopsins are BL-OG fusion proteins, connecting bioluminescent luciferases with optogenetic actuators that can stimulate or inhibit neural circuits through administration of a small-molecule luciferin. Luminopsins drive robust fluctuations in MUA activity in neocortex with a response that is sensitive and proportional to luciferin availability [Gomez-Ramirez, et al., 2019]. Because they will provide several distinct benefits, we are creating an array of photoswitchable (PS) Luminopsins that enable brighter and color-shifted luciferase light production after activation. First, this strategy allows selection of specific cells (e.g., members of a neural ensemble sharing similar tuning) to achieve sustained chemogenetic control lasting up to several hours. To our knowledge, this construct is the first to provide such selectivity in chemogenetics. Second, because BL-OG cellular control is directly proportional to BL light production, photon emission allows real-time tracking of the duration and magnitude of PS-activated chemogenetic control: Relating the strength of ensemble manipulation to behavioral variables, re-energizing ensemble control, or choosing alternative ensembles can therefore be conducted optimally. Third, in contrast to holographic optogenetics, PS does not require maximal light delivery in a discrete millisecond-specific window, and can therefore be applied to deeper targets and a much larger array of cells, providing a more robust option for many experimental goals. To date, we have developed multiple Luminopsin constructs that are effectively photo-switched "on" through activated availability for bioluminescent FRET (BRET). We have now confirmed robust PS BL-OG activation can be achieved in mouse neocortical neurons <i>in vivo</i>, showing substantially brighter and color-shifted output when activated. Further, these constructs show robust two-photon (2P)-driven PS, providing a high degree of precision in choosing cells or processes to modulate. We are currently testing the magnitude of electrophysiological effects following PS BL-OG activation in neurons and the impact this molecule has on well-controlled psychophysical behavior.'

        abstract:'Patterns of neuronal activity during early development are believed to guide the assembly of neural circuits. Thus, alterations of neuronal activity in this time window may cause structural and functional changes that persist into adulthood. Specific alterations may lead to unique patterns of aberrant circuit formation, a mechanism which has been implicated in some psychiatric conditions such as autism. We took advantage of a bimodal experimental approach, bioluminescence-driven optogenetics, to assess the impact of hyperexciting pyramidal cells in layer V of the neocortex during early development. To enable highly specified manipulation of pyramidal cell activity in layer V, mice expressing the excitatory luciferase-opsin fusion LMO3 (sbGluc fused to VChR1) under a Lox-Stop-Lox sequence were crossed with Rbp4-Cre mice. In presence of the luciferase substrate coelenterazine (CTZ), light emission from sbGluc drives activation of VChR1 to depolarize the cell and evoke action potentials. CTZ was delivered intraperitoneally once per day during post-natal days 4-14 in the developing mouse pups; a control group received a vehicle treatment instead of CTZ. Starting at postnatal day 50 (P50), we examined the behavior of all mice across several testing paradigms. To standardize our quantification of behavioral data we implemented DeepLabCut, an open-source machine learning tool that leverages recent advances in computer vision to allow accurate, markerless tracking of animal limbs across behavior testing videos. Three deep residual neural networks were each trained on 100-300 human-labeled frames from open field, elevated plus maze, or novel object videos, respectively. The networks were used to analyze full videos of tests corresponding to their training data: an analysis of one video outputs a dataframe of X/Y coordinates and labeling confidence values (0 < p < 1) for each user-specified “body part”, indexed frame-by-frame in temporal order. This positional data can be used to measure many different behavioral phenotypes downstream. Here, we quantified the total amount of time (number of frames divided by the video’s frame rate) that each mouse’s snout or centroid was located within user-specified regions of interest. Regions of the open field arena were defined manually per video; our elevated plus maze algorithm was trained to label each corner of the arena, so rectangular ROIs corresponding to each ‘arm’ could be defined automatically during analysis (utilizing code from Sturman et al., 2020). The latter approach was less labor-intensive and more robust to variability in camera position. CTZ-treated Rbp4-Cre/LSL-LMO3 mice displayed adult behavioral phenotypes similar to those observed in our previous study, where pyramidal neurons in all layers of the neocortex were hyperexcited in the Emx-Cre/LSL-LMO3 mouse line during the same time window (P4-14). In conclusion, we leveraged the versatility of a dual chemogenetic and optogenetic method to study the impact of neuronal hyperexcitation during early development on adult neurophysiology and behavior. Exploratory analysis demonstrates the viability of a DeepLabCut data pipeline and shows ASD-like behavioral deficits in adult mice following developmental hyperexcitation of layer V neocortical pyramidal neurons.'

        abstract:'BioLuminescent-OptoGenetics (BL-OG) is a minimally invasive approach in which genetically expressed luciferases are tethered to opsins. In the presence of the luciferase substrate coelenterazine (CTZ), the generated light activates the opsins and alters ion flow. Thus, neuronal activity can be manipulated without the need for invasive surgeries and LEDs. Here, we developed three excitatory luciferase-opsin constructs (luminopsins; LMO) using a red-shifted version of Renilla Luciferase (RLuc8.6) tethered to red-shifted opsins. In each red-shifted LMO, RLuc8.6 was fused to a different fluorescent protein, generating different peak emission wavelengths (592nm, 589nm, 560nm). The cation channel ChrimsonR was utilized in the two red-most LMOs while Volvox carteri channelrhodopsin-1 (VChR1) was utilized in the more yellow shifted LMO. Upon IVIS imaging, the bioluminescent emission recordings confirmed LMO expression in cortical neurons. After CTZ stimulation, current clamp recordings showed that LMOs with ChrimsonR were more robust, exhibiting more consistent and higher frequency neuronal spiking, than the LMO with VchR1. Additionally, CTZ stimulation during voltage clamp recordings showed that LMOs with ChrimsonR had consistently more pronounced inwardly directed current when compared to the LMO with VchR1. These findings suggest the potential application of our red shifted LMOs as optogenetic tools for manipulation of independent neural populations when coupled with previously described blue shifted optogenetic tools, thus allowing for multi-modal control of neural circuitry.'

        abstract:'In the last decade, different chemogenetic tools have been developed that are allowing neural circuits to be controlled and investigated non-invasively, which in turn has many clinical applications. Chemogenetics uses synthetic or orthogonal proteins that respond to otherwise inert ligands to control neural activity. These genetically encoded proteins act as actuators in cellular pathways and can be targeted to specific cell populations ultimately leading to changes in neuronal membrane potential. DREADDs, or Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs, are engineered G-protein coupled receptors while Pharmacologically Selective Actuator Modules, or PSAMs, are ligand-gated ion channels. Luminopsins, LMOs, a third chemogenetic technology, change the neuronal membrane potential by conducting ions through a channel, like PSAMs. Unique to LMOs is that it does this in a light-dependent manner through bioluminescent activation of light-sensing ion channels in the presence of a luciferin. Extensive studies report the causal effects of chemogenetic activation of circuits driving animal behavior, yet we have a limited understanding of the neurophysiological changes arising from a direct consequence of their implementation. To address this knowledge gap, cultured cortical neurons were transduced with viral constructs each containing an excitatory chemogenetic actuator (1) DREADDs, (2) PSAMs, or (3) LMOs. On DIV 17-19, the expressing cortical neurons were chronically treated with the appropriate chemical ligand once a day for five days to selectively activate each respective chemogenetic actuator. Microelectrode array recordings of spontaneous baseline activity revealed an increase in firing rate when neurons were chronically excited using DREADDs. However, all three groups of stimulated neurons were less responsive to electrical stimulation than the vehicle-treated culture, suggesting that the stimulated neurons have decreased excitability after treatment. To determine if chronic chemogenetic stimulation alters neuronal morphology, Sholl analysis revealed more complex dendrite arborization in chronically stimulated neurons as compared to the control. Chronic stimulation of cultured cortical neurons with three distinct chemogenetic technologies impacts neural physiology in unique ways. To bridge these chemogenetic technologies to the clinic, it is pertinent to characterize any electrophysiological and morphological alterations that arise due to implementing chemogenetic technology—warranting further investigations <i>in vivo</i>.'

By investigating alterations in circuitry through hyperexcitation in the developing brain, adult behavior can be assessed for phenotypic examples of psychiatric disorders. To test the impact of hyperexcitation of neuronal circuitry during early postnatal development, we took advantage of Bioluminescent Optogenetics (BL-OG), where light stimulation of an optogenetic element is achieved either through bioluminescence emitted from a tethered luciferase upon application of a chemical substrate or through physical light via fiber optics. Mice conditionally expressing LMO3, a fusion of sbGluc luciferase and the blue light sensing opsin VChR1, were crossed with Emx1-Cre transgenic mice, thus limiting expression of LMO3 to cortical pyramidal neurons. Overexcitation of developing pyramidal neurons was achieved chemogenetically by administering the luciferase substrate coelenterazine intraperitoneally during postnatal days 4-14. During adulthood, <i>in vivo</i> extracellular recordings of neocortical circuits revealed functional deficits in excitability. Additionally, alterations in excitatory and inhibitory balance were seen at both the electrophysiological and cytoarchitectural level.

Recently, advances in wearable microscopy expanded the range of accessible behaviors by allowing imaging of freely behaving animals. However, wearable microscopes to this day are primarily used for brain imaging and have not been adopted for imaging other parts of the body, for example the spinal cord. Furthermore, unfavorable attributes of FL indicators constrain the extent of imaging experiments, including photobleaching, autofluorescence and excitation light scattering noise especially in the parts of the body like the spinal cord due to myelination. All 3 of these issues can be eliminated while offering an increase in the imaging depth by using bioluminescence (BL) instead of the FL. <br><br>Here we demonstrate our ability of imaging BL calcium indicators through the cranial window in mice as fast as 5 frames per second using redesigned open-source miniscopes. Furthermore, we present an expansion of the miniscope use towards neurovascular imaging in the spinal cord. Spinal neurovascular imaging is accomplished by integrating a custom vertebral implant with miniscope hardware that ensures mechanical stability over time. Such implants allow interchangeable imaging of the brain or spinal cord in free or restrained animals. Altogether, our work expands the imaging toolbox towards better imaging quality via BL indicators and the ability to image across multiple sites throughout the nervous system using wearable miniature microscopes."

In contrast, almost no methods exist for selectively modulating communication between defined cells at the synaptic level, which is key to understanding how functional connectivity creates percepts, engrams and actions. Here, we advance a novel strategy for selectively modulating synaptic transmission, Inter-luminescence. This approach uses bioluminescent light from a presynaptic axon terminal, generated by a luciferase, to modulate an opsin in its postsynaptic target under experimenter-controlled introduction of a small molecule (luciferin). We developed two separate methods that target the luciferase to the synaptic cleft. To provide sustained and synapse-specific regulation, the ‘Persist-Int’ strategy places a luciferase in the synaptic cleft tethered to the presynaptic terminal, and an opsin in the opposing postsynaptic membrane. In this configuration, light generation creates sustained and activity-independent modulation. In the complementary ‘Act-Int’ strategy, luciferase is released into the synaptic cleft in response to presynaptic activity, a synapse-specific form of activity-dependent modulation.<br><a href='https://doi.org/10.26300/5n5r-2f66' class=bl-link target=_blank>View this poster in the Brown Digital Repository</a>."

We call this approach PhotoSwitchable BL-OG, or PS-BL-OG. To actualize PS-BL-OG, we have engineered a set of monomeric, high-contrast photoswitchable fluorescent proteins that can be activated with 2p illumination and that thermally relax to an “off” state in the dark with time scales from minutes to hours. In parallel, we have developed a set of <i>Oplophorus</i> luciferase variants with a range of catalytic rates and emission quantum yields to act as Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) donors to the photoswitchable fluorescent proteins. Assays using first-generation PS-BL-OG constructs in neurons <i>in vitro</i> and in living mice have so far demonstrated that the intensity of bioluminescent light emission is controllable via FRET in these constructs, and that photoswitching of bioluminescent output is achievable <i>in vivo</i>. Electrophysiology from these animals has also provided early indications that, even in non-optimized fusion configurations, optogenetic actuators also respond in a photoswitching-dependent manner. <i>In vitro</i> assays of our current-generation constructs have demonstrated higher contrast in bioluminescent light emission as well as much higher brightness relative to first-generation constructs.

The NeuroNex Bioluminescence Database lists bioluminescent molecules, their publication sources, and their molecular properties with specifics upon its compatible substrates, peak emission spectra, endogenous organism, size, signal, and more. Under the implications of this toolbox, neuroscientists and researchers may be better equipped to apply specific and appropriate bioluminescent molecules to their individual research projects quicker and more efficiently. A historical analysis of the database was conducted after obtaining nearly one hundred different bioluminescent molecules from prior publications. Due to the lack of technology and other unknown factors, earlier works lacked in the specification of molecular properties. Whereas, recent works were more elaborate on these properties. This may suggest that the first luciferases, or bioluminescent molecules, discovered may be the ones we know the least about.

BL light is created when a small molecule luciferin binds a luciferase and releases photons.  For cellular control, we combine BL with OptoGenetics (‘BL-OG’), placing the luciferase in molecular proximity to the activated opsin.  In our LuMinOpsin (LMO) strategy, a luciferase is tethered to an opsin, providing multiple experimental options in a single molecule: An LMO can be used for sustained, distributed chemogenetic modulation—when the luciferin is administered—or focal, temporally brief OG activation with external light. BL-OG also provides a unique temporally-precise photon report of engagement between the small-molecule driver and its target. The best established LMO—LMO3—is now being employed in a range of novel research applications.<br><br> Recent Hub progress includes development of a novel bright luciferase, elk9h, that produces robust light following intravenous or intraperitoneal luciferin injection <i>in vivo</i>. The new LMO7, created by elk9h-opsin pairing, also creates substantially stronger <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> activation. We also modified elk9h and related luciferases to create novel BL calcium indicators that do not require fluorescent light, eliminating photobleaching/damage and simplifying miniscope design. BL calcium indicators also provide the unique possibility of highly-local, activity-dependent self-regulation, where light production created by neural activity drives/silences opsins. In related progress, our Hub has developed multiple Interluminescent approaches.  In this strategy, BL and OG are placed in different neurons, creating synapse-specific modulation of functional connectivity. Our Interluminescent approaches can now provide selective, sustained and activity-dependent modulation between neural pairs. <br><br>Our Hub also provides substantial BL education.

      abstract: 'Targeted modulation of genetically identified neural populations can be achieved by a number of approaches that meet specific experimental needs. If intended activation or inhibition of neurons is not limited to millisecond precision in turning activity on or off, chemogenetic approaches that activate ligands with small molecules are best suited. In parallel to DREADDs and PSAMs we developed an orthogonal approach, BL-OG, using bioluminescent light (BL) to drive optogenetic responses (OG). Injection of a small molecule (a ‘luciferin’) causes light production through a chemical interaction with a genetically expressed luciferase enzyme tethered to optogenetic elements; this light in turn activates the opsin and controls cell activity. Under this BRAIN U01 we significantly improved and expanded BL-OG tools and validated their use <i>in vivo</i> as follows. 1. Using molecular evolution and directed mutagenesis we generated luciferases and luciferase-fluorescent protein BRET probes with many-fold increased light emission. 2. We combined these improved light emitters with excitatory and inhibitory opsins with increased light sensitivity and distinct features (SFOs, anion channels), generating a palette of highly efficient BL-OG tools. 3. We tested these tools <i>in vivo</i>, finding them to perform robustly in rats and mice expressing constructs virally transduced and as conditional transgenes. 4. We compared routes of administration (intracranial, intravenous, intraperitoneal) and concentration of luciferin with time course and amplitude of neural responses. 5. We evaluated the potential for non-specific effects of luciferase light production or luciferin administration <i>in vivo</i> and found neither to drive effects independent of BL-OG expression when used at established concentrations. 6. We are disseminating plasmids on Addgene, mice at JAX, and protocols and examples on our website (http://www.bioluminescencehub.org/). In summary, we validated a toolset that is robust, specific, versatile, modular and combinatorial. As all BL-OG combinations allow both chemogenetic and conventional optogenetic activation with a single molecular actuator, this is also the only bimodal tool.'

As designed, this PS-/PA-BL approach will allow rapid selection (minutes), quick re-set (hours), and can be implemented across depths by selective 2-photon (2p) activation. Neural control will be implemented by using PS-BL light to drive optogenetics (PS-BL-OG), a powerful modulation strategy. The PS-/PA-BL approach exceeds efficacy and spatial extent of current simultaneous optogenetic regulation by holography. It also has distinct advantages over methods that generate optogenetic sensitivity in cells based on activity-linked transcription by faster on- and off-set, and gives the experimenter control over selection of cells by criteria other than that of highest activity. Here, we present our initial progress towards realizing this new technology, focusing on the first Aim, in which we generate PS-BL by fusing luciferases to reversibly photoswitchable fluorescent proteins (PSFPs), selecting for optimal Förster resonance energy transfer and bright emission following optical activation. Towards this Aim, we have focused on three major technological challenges: (1) Using structure-guided directed evolution, we have improved the properties of our bright, high-contrast, monomeric PSFP, PSmOfo, which maintains a “default” non-fluorescent (“off”) state, unlike most PSFPs. The most advanced variants of PSmOfo now have brightness similar to other bright green FPs, and maintains the high on/off contrast in fluorescence brightness required for our PS-BL approach. (2) We have generated and screened libraries of FRET fusions of PSmOfo variants to bright luciferases and demonstrated robust energy transfer in the activated state. (3) We have demonstrated robust photoswitching of AAV-transduced neurons in living mice of an earlier PSmOfo-luciferase fusion using 2p excitation.'

Thus, alterations in neuronal activity during this time period may lead to aberrant circuit formation, a mechanism that has been implicated in certain psychiatric disorders such as autism. Here we took advantage of a bimodal experimental approach, bioluminescence-driven optogenetics, to assess the impact of cortical pyramidal cell hyperexcitation during this critical time period. To enable manipulation of cortical pyramidal cell activity during development, mice expressing the excitatory luciferase-opsin fusion LMO3 (sbGluc fused to VChR1) under a Lox-Stop-Lox sequence were crossed with Emx1-Cre mice. In presence of the luciferase substrate coelenterazine (CTZ), light emission from sbGluc drives activation of VChR1 to depolarize the cell and evoke action potential firing. CTZ was delivered intraperitoneally once a day during post-natal days 4-14 in developing mouse pups. Starting at postnatal day 50 (P50), mice that received either CTZ or vehicle treatment during development were tested in a number of behavioral paradigms and effects on morphological and electrophysiological properties were examined. Behavioral testing revealed that CTZ-treated Emx1-Cre/LSL-LMO3 mice display adult behavioral phenotypes similar to those observed in existing animal models of autism. Taking advantage of the option to interrogate the same LMO3-expressing neurons using optogenetics in <i>in vivo</i> and <i>ex vivo</i> electrophysiological recordings from cortex, these animals showed evidence of neurophysiological alterations in the form of altered neuronal network oscillations, excitation-inhibition balance and intrinsic excitability. In conclusion, we leveraged the advantage of a dual chemo- and optogenetic approach to study the impact of neuronal activity during early development on adult neurophysiology and behavior that could aid investigation of pathophysiological mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders such as autism.'

While often significantly higher in signal-to-noise ratio, the overall lower signal intensity of luciferase output is a challenge. As such, imaging calcium or other cofactor-dependent bioluminescent indicators requires minimization of emission light losses, and optimization of the imaging sensor’s sensitivity. Here, we demonstrate a modified version of the open-source UCLA miniscope for bioluminescence imaging. The removal of excitation light optics reduces the number of assembly components by ~60%, and weight by ~20%. The reduction in components and the use of high-resolution stereolitographic (SLA) 3D printing also provides significant flexibility for the optical path design optimization to reduce the photon loss, to add complementary functions such as electrical stimulation or recording, and to adapt the microscope for imaging other parts of the body such as the spinal cord. The studies employing miniature microscopes to date have been primarily focused on brain imaging and existing designs have not been optimized for chronic use to image the spinal cord. Key challenges remain when imaging the spinal cord, in particular significant movement artifact. Here, we will also describe an implant design for attaching the miniature microscope to the spinal cord, and demonstrate the adaptation of motion correction algorithms for spinal cord imaging applications. We are currently validating the above described innovations by demonstrating bioluminescence imaging in the spinal cord of the mouse. A major goal of our project is to expand the utility of open-source miniature microscopes to new avenues of scientific inquiry (e.g., spinal cord imaging). As part of the technology sharing objectives of this NSF Bioluminescence Hub, all designs presented here are available online for use by all members of the scientific community.'

We previously demonstrated that such “biological” light can activate optogenetic elements, such as channelrhodopsins and pumps, effecting membrane potential changes and resulting in activation or silencing of neurons <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. We explored whether bioluminescent light production can be utilized beyond activating ion-moving photoreceptors to the larger array of photosensory proteins employed as optical switches in cellular processes such as protein translocation and transcription. In initial proof-of-concept experiments we co-transfected HEK293 cells with a blue light emitting luciferase and a blue light sensing photoreceptor. Light emitters were sbGLuc, a copepod luciferase variant, NanoLuc, a luciferase derived from shrimp, as well as two novel engineered synthetic luciferases. Photoreceptors were CRY/CIB, a light-gated dimerization system, and LOV, based on light dependent protein unhinging. Bioluminescence driven activation of these photoreceptors was measured as increased transcription of luminescent and fluorescent reporter proteins in direct comparison to LED driven activation. Quantification of bioluminescence driven photoreceptor activation revealed that both light-gated switches, cryptochrome protein dimerization and light-oxygen-voltage J-alpha helix unfolding can be efficiently activated by biological light sources. Furthermore, the higher light emission of our synthetic luciferases resulted in better activation of transcription. There are many ways to improve further on these basic results.

In this approach, genetically expressed luciferases bind with injected luciferins to produce cold light. The photons bind to localized to genetically expressed optogenetic and calcium indicating molecules. One benefit of this approach is widespread, genetically-targeted, non-invasive neural activation or read-out through peripheral injection of the luciferin. In past studies, luminescence has been seen through the skull after peripheral injection at low spatial and temporal resolutions. In somatosensory cortex neurons, we expressed NCS-2, a noved bright luciferase composed of mNeonGreen tethered to ekL9H, a shrimp-based luciferase variant. We injected our luciferin, h-CTZ, intraperitoneally(IP) and intravenously(IV) through the lateral tail vein, imaging at a high spatial resolution and quantifying the time course of luciferase activation. We observed a stronger peak activation of NCS2 when h-CTZ was injected IV, and a longer activation when h-CTZ was injected IP. These results show that both IV and IP delivery of h-CTZ can drive robust bioluminescence in cortical neurons.'

      abstract: 'The ability to manipulate specific neuronal populations of the spinal cord following spinal cord injury (SCI) could potentially prove highly beneficial for rehabilitation in patients through maintaining and strengthening still existing neuronal connections and/or facilitating the formation of new connections. A non-invasive and highly specific approach to neuronal stimulation is bioluminescent-optogenetics, where genetically expressed light emitting luciferases are tethered to light sensitive channelrhodopsins (luminopsins, LMO); neurons are activated by the addition of the luciferase substrate coelenterazine (CTZ). This approach takes advantage of utilizing ion channels for current conduction while activating the channels through application of a small chemical compound, thus allowing non-invasive stimulation and recruitment of all targeted neurons. We previously showed the efficacy of this approach in improving locomotor recovery following severe spinal cord injury in rats expressing the excitatory LMO3 under control of a pan-neuronal and motor neuron specific promoter; CTZ was applied through a lateral ventricle cannula. Here we transduced spinal cord neurons with a synapsin-driven step function LMO, SFLMO(CS). In this construct the Gaussia luciferase variant sbGLuc is fused to the step function opsin ChR2(CS). As SFOs are significantly more light sensitive than other opsins, we stimulated transduced lumbar neurons by intraperitoneal application of CTZ, allowing for a less invasive treatment.'

Our tool targets bioluminescent enzymes to presynaptic vesicles and optogenetic elements to postsynaptic membranes.

Out of all of the common methods used in medicine, most of the spinal cord injury treatment procedures have negative trade-offs that could permanently damage neurons. We are going to couple a non-invasive method to target neurons after injury along with swim therapy. In the case of this study we will be able to target interneurons of the spinal cord by combing an adeno associated virus (AAV) serotype 2/9 with asynapsinpromoter to restrict gene expression and subsequent stimulation to interneurons of the spinal cord. The AAV also expresses a light-emitting luciferase fused to a channelrhodopsin, which is light sensitive. Neural cells will be stimulated by the addition of Coelenterazine (CTZ), which is the luciferase substrate. CTZ injections will ultimately lead to activation of synaptic networks of neurons that express the excitatory luminopsins. The HumanSynapsinPromoter (hSYN1) can drive expression of the luminopsin, LMO3, which is stimulated by CTZ in adult rats. This will result in functional connectivity across the site of injury, aiding in the recovery of locomotion below the site of injury. After the interneural spinal cord stimulation, rigorous swim testing and therapy will be conducted in order to analyze the effects of the swim testing. Constant gait analyses will be done in order to evaluate the progression of the gait of the rats after injury and throughout the treatment.'

      abstract: 'Early development is marked by spontaneous neuronal activity that occurs without the input of sensory experience. This spontaneous activity has been demonstrated in select pathways to refine foundational neural circuits before sensory input. By manipulating this activity in genetically-targeted pyramidal neuronswithin the cortex, we can experimentally test its role in formation of specific neural circuits. Many psychiatric disorders are thought to be neurodevelopmental, stemming from malformation of neural circuits in early development. Autism disorders in particular have been associated with increased cortical excitation leading to a cortical imbalance of excitation to inhibition. Early disruptions to cortical activity may underlie the later manifestation of E/I imbalance resulting in behavioral changes typical of disorders such as autism. We report here on the first unbiased testing of the role of developmental over-excitation in altering adult behavior and circuit dynamics. <br><br>We took advantage of Bioluminescent Optogenetics (BL-OG), where light stimulation of an optogenetic element is achieved either through bioluminescence emitted from a tethered luciferase upon application of a chemical substrate or through application of physical light via fiber optics, for chemogenetic activation during development and for optogenetic interrogation in adult animals. Mice conditionally expressing LMO3, a fusion of sbGLuc and VChR1, were crossed with Emx1-Cre transgenic mice, thus limiting expression of LMO3 to cortical pyramidal neurons. By delivering CTZ intraperitoneally during post-natal days 4-14, over-excitation was induced in the cortical pyramidal neurons of developing mouse pups. During adulthood, mice were tested behaviorally, and assessed for electrophysiological changes in circuit dynamics. Behavioral phenotypes are consistent with autism spectrum disorders, including social deficits and repetitive behaviors. Optogenetic circuit interrogation demonstrates disrupted cortico-striatal circuitry, as well as altered E/I balance in the cortex. The results of this research directly implicate cortical over-excitation during early postnatal development to behavioral phenotypes characteristic of autism disorders. <a class=bl-link href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.18.911347v1?rss=1" target="_blank">Read more about this work on bioRxiv</a>.'

The Hub will advance bioluminescence as a transformative tool in neuroscience through three Aims: Innovation, Dissemination and Education. Innovation will target four key goals: Qualitative increases in bioluminescence brightness, an advance that will enable imaging and control broadly; Inter-luminescence, a means of using bioluminescence to drive optogenetic sensors across a synapse, thereby creating a novel optical pathway for neural communication; Testing <i>in vivo</i> new bright and fast calcium-sensitive luciferases, utilizing newly developed instrumentation for bioluminescence imaging; and, elaboration of control and imaging bioluminescence methods to other key models: worm, fly, fish, and primates. Dissemination targets the goal of Horizontal Open Science (sharing among scientists), i.e. developing and implementing strategies for free exchange of tools and information that foments progress and collaboration among disciplines. This is accomplished by a Hub website (http://www.bioluminescencehub.org/), Symposia, and by providing opportunities for direct training in bioluminescence methods, including Workshops and Emissaries, where members of our group visit laboratories and help them adopt our tools. Education targets the goal of Vertical Open Science (sharing across levels of understanding). We are using bioluminescence to energize science knowledge and appreciation in students and the public. We are focusing on developing a new integrated curriculum on bioluminescence that describes its biology, chemistry, physics, and its applications in neuroscience for imaging and control. This curriculum will be taught to students at all levels. Our flagship educational event is an intensive, 1-week Practicum for undergraduate students at the Marine Biological Laboratory. This course includes lectures and hands-on laboratory lessons using bioluminescent animals and engineered bioluminescent constructs.'

      abstract: 'Optogenetics uses light to activate neural channels or pumps genetically-expressed in distinct cell classes, enabling control of cell-specific circuits <i>in vivo</i>. A limitation of current optogenetic approaches is the use of external light sources (e.g., fiber optics) to drive opsins that excite or inhibit cell activity. Fiber optics are typically implanted in the brain, which can create a pathway for infections, and are punitive when manipulating widespread networks, because insertion of several fibers can cause considerable tissue damage. We developed an integrative optical- and chemo-genetic method, termed BioLuminescent-Optogenetics (BL-OG), that leverages internally-generated bioluminescence to activate optogenetic elements without the use of fiber optics. In BL-OG, a genetically-engineered molecule (Luminopsin-3, LMO3) tethers the slow-burn <i>Gaussia</i> Luciferase (sbGLuc) to the opsin Volvox-ChannelRhodopsin (VChR1) that is activated by bioluminescence when the luciferin Coelenterazine (CTZ) binds to sbGLuc. Although we have shown that BL-OG robustly modulates neural activity and behavior, it is unclear whether CTZ and/or its oxidized byproduct Coelenteramide (CTM) can cause non-specific neural effects. Here, we show that BL-OG substantially drives neural activity without creating off target effects <i>in vivo</i>. We performed imaging and electrophysiological recordings in mouse primary somatosensory cortex while injecting CTZ or CTM. We found a CTZ dose (~0.4uL) that substantially modulated multi-unit activity (MUA) without creating off target effects. Specifically, we observed that CTZ enhanced MUA (~25%) in animals expressing LMO3, whereas produced no MUA changes in wild type animals (~3% increase). Similarly, we failed to find MUA changes in wild type mice injected with CTM (~0.5%). Finally, we observed that bioluminescent light very weakly increased MUA (~5%) in animals expressing the sbGLuc without a VChR1 opsin, suggesting that bioluminescence minimally drives neural activity through photovoltaic mechanisms. Our study shows that BL-OG evokes significant and highly selective effects, providing yet an additional advantage over leading chemogenetic methods. <a class=bl-link href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/709931v1" target="_blank">Read more about this work on bioRxiv</a>.'

      abstract: 'Bioluminescent molecules for imaging and modifying neural activity are increasingly becoming viable tools for <i>in vivo</i> use and have the potential to overcome many of the drawbacks of fluorescent imaging and traditional optogenetics and chemigenetics. As opposed to fluorescent indicators of neural activity, bioluminescent indicators require no outside light source, improving the signal-to-noise ratio by reducing autofluorescence, scattering, and photo-bleaching. Further, bioluminescent actuators are advantageous over traditional optogenetics in that light does not have to be externally delivered, as it is self-generated, greatly reducing the invasiveness of the technique. Despite these powerful advances, certain hurdles remain to be overcome to achieve optimal <i>in vivo</i> imaging of bioluminescence. Here we present a suite of techniques for imaging bioluminescent activity in the cortex of awake, behaving mice. A major obstacle of engaging bioluminescent molecules <i>in vivo</i> is that it requires the delivery of a bioluminescent substrate (luciferin) to cells expressing the corresponding enzyme (luciferase). We introduce a microfluidic device that allows for delivery of luciferins directly to cortical neurons expressing luciferases. The device is optically transparent, light weight, and inexpensive to produce. The device is constructed mainly from Polydimethylsiloxane, a widely used silicone-based organic polymer, cured in a 3D printed mold. The microfluidic properties of the device allow for rapid wash-on and wash-off of luciferin, providing for more temporally precise and precisely repeatable measurements. Coupled with an electron multiplying charged-coupled device (Andor iXon) for low-light, fast and high-resolution imaging and wide-field fluorescence co-registration, our strategy offers a systematic approach for high-resolution testing and use of bioluminescent tools.'

      abstract: 'New tools to selectively regulate neurons have revolutionized causal neuroscience experimentation. Optogenetics provides an array of elements for specific biophysical control, while designer chemogenetic receptors provide a minimally invasive method to control circuits in vivo by peripheral injection. We developed a strategy for selective regulation of activity in specific cells that integrates opto- and chemo-genetic approaches, and thus allows manipulation of neuronal activity over a range of spatial and temporal scales in the same experimental animal. Light-sensing molecules, opsins, are activated by biologically produced light through luciferases, bioluminescence, upon peripheral injection of a small molecule (bioluminescence driven optogenetics, BL-OG). Importantly, BL-OG allows conventional fiber optic use of optogenetic sensors, while at the same time providing chemogenetic access to the same sensors. Towards metric-driven validation of the technology under in vivo experimental conditions we quantified effects on neural responses by in vivo multi electrode recordings, directly comparing stimulation of opsins by luciferase emitted bioluminescence versus fiber optics versus DREADDs.

        abstract: 'Bioluminescent Ca2+ sensors have distinct advantages over fluorescent Ca2+ indicators; first and foremost they function without external illumination. Rather, they produce light in the presence of Ca2+ and of a luciferase substrate, a feature that can be exploited for combining Ca2+ sensing with optogenetic applications. We developed a bioluminescent Ca2+ indicator, Lumicampsin (LMC) that employs a split, mutated <i>Gaussia</i> luciferase (sbGluc) with a CaM-M13 calcium sensing moiety introduced between the two split halves. To date we have several versions of LMC with varying sensitivities to Ca2+ by using different, pre-established CaM-M13s (from GCaMP6f, GCaMP6m, GCaMP6s, etc.). In order to investigate subcellular Ca2+ dynamics, we have fitted the LMC with various organelle localizing sequences that effectively shuttles it to the organelles of interest (ER, Mitochondria and Golgi apparatus). The superior light emission from LMC, capable of producing a delta RLU/RLUo of around 200% <i>in vitro</i>, has motivated us to explore activity dependent neuronal modulation by co-expressing LMCs with various optogenetic elements in primary neuronal cultures. We are currently optimizing conditions to achieve reliable and efficient coupling of Ca2+-induced light production and optogenetic effector activation.',

When light emitter and light sensor are tethered, as in luciferase-opsin fusion proteins (luminopsins, LMO), application of luciferase substrate coelenterazine (CTZ) and subsequent light production will change the membrane potential of the cell expressing the LMO. Here we co-cultured cortical neurons expressing the luciferase with hippocampal neurons expressing the opsin, with the goal of investigating BL-OG effects across synapses between these two neuronal populations. Neurons isolated from E18 rat cortex and hippocampus were nucleofected with a pre-synaptically targeted luciferase construct and either an excitatory or inhibitory opsin construct, respectively, and were plated on multi-electrode array (MEA) dishes using a two-chamber silicon insert to separate the two populations. Neuronal processes originating from both populations crossed the gap separating them, forming synaptic contacts between cortical and hippocampal neurons. Recordings were carried out between DIVs 14-28. External blue light from an LED source was used to modulate opsin expressing hippocampal neurons directly, while bioluminescence emission by cortical neurons generated with application of CTZ was used to drive hippocampal neurons across synapses. Responses from hippocampal neurons elicited with CTZ were likely due to trans-synaptic communication. Electrical stimulations of cortical neurons by individual electrodes were carried out in parallel to confirm the inter-population connectivity. The overall effect of CTZ application on activity of opsin-expressing hippocampal neurons in the co-cultures was significantly higher compared to that of non-expressing hippocampal neurons and of the cortical neurons in the co-cultures. Such biological light activation, across synaptic partners originating from brain regions known to be synaptically connected, offers the potential to optogenetically dissect synaptic communication non-invasively.',

        abstract: 'Early development is marked by spontaneous neuronal activity that occurs without the input of sensory experience. This spontaneous activity has been demonstrated to refine foundational neural circuits before sensory input. By manipulating this activity in genetically-targeted pyramidal neurons within the cortex, we can interfere with the normal formation of specific neural circuits. Many psychiatric disorders are thought to be neurodevelopmental, stemming from malformation of neural circuits in early development. Autism disorders in particular have been associated with increased cortical excitation leading to a cortical imbalance of excitation to inhibition. Early disruptions to cortical activity may result in behavioral changes that correlate with psychiatric phenotypes typical of disorders such as autism. Using optogenetics, we can manipulate neuronal activity using light. Due to the young age of the animals used in this study, a non-invasive light source must be used. Our laboratory has created mice that conditionally express a luciferase protein, sbGLuc, tethered to a channelrhodopsin, VChR1. This luminescent opsin, or luminopsin (LMO3), produces light, and thus a neuronal response, in the presence of the substrate coelenterazine (CTZ), which can be delivered intraperitoneally (IP). Lox-Stop-Lox LMO3 mice were crossed with Emx1-Cre transgenic mice, thus limiting expression of LMO3 to cortical pyramidal neurons. By delivering CTZ IP during post-natal days 4-14, a hyperexcitation can be induced in the cortical pyramidal neurons of developing mouse pups. During adulthood, mice are tested behaviorally, and assessed for morphological and electrophysiological changes. Behavioral results indicate behavioral phenotypes consistent with autism behaviors. Electrophysiology indicates strongly increased excitation to inhibition and a lack of synchrony in the cortex. The results of this research will provide insight into the effect of altered developmental activity and its relationship to psychiatric disease.',

      abstract: 'The ability to manipulate specific neuronal populations of the spinal cord following spinal cord injury (SCI) could potentially prove highly beneficial for rehabilitation in patients through maintaining and strengthening still existing neuronal connections and/or facilitating the formation of new connections. A non-invasive and highly specific approach to neuronal stimulation is bioluminescent-optogenetics, where genetically expressed light emitting luciferases are tethered to light sensitive channelrhodopsins (luminopsins, LMO); neurons are activated by the addition of the luciferase substrate coelenterazine (CTZ). This approach takes advantage of utilizing ion channels for current conduction while activating the channels through application of a small chemical compound, thus allowing non-invasive stimulation and recruitment of all targeted neurons. Rats were transduced in the lumbar spinal cord with AAV2/9 expressing the excitatory LMO3 under control of the synapsin or the Hb9 promoter. A day after contusion injury of the thoracic spine, rats received either CTZ or vehicle every other day for 2 weeks. We found activation of either interneuron or motor neuron populations below the level of injury to significantly improve locomotor recovery. This is the first example of non-invasive activation of an optogenetic component as a potential therapy following spinal cord injury. We are utilizing morphological and histological methods to identify mechanisms underlying improvements in locomotion. The findings will provide a foundation for a rational approach to spinal cord injury, thereby advancing approaches for functional recovery after SCI in the preclinical arena. <a class=bl-link href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/710194v1" target="_blank">Read more about this work on bioRxiv.</a>',

      abstract: 'Fluorescence imaging with genetically-encoded calcium indicators, such as GCaMP, has provided fundamental insights into the role of cell-specific populations in neural coding and perception. Recent advances and pragmatic advantages have made 1-photon imaging a viable strategy for interrogating activity within and across large-scale neural populations. Yet, a limitation of fluorescence imaging is that the technique requires a light source to excite fluorescent proteins. This light creates artifacts that may lead to a reduction in the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the image. Noise artifacts from the excitation light include: (1) Autofluorescence, (2) Photon scattering from the incoming light, and (3) Photobleaching. As an alternative to fluorescent imaging, we are developing calcium-dependent genetically-encoded molecules using bioluminescent probes. Bioluminescence is chemically generated light that occurs when a photon-containing molecule (luciferin) is catalyzed by a photoenzyme (luciferase). Bioluminescence does not require light excitation and creates very little thermal reaction, thus substantially reducing noise related to autofluoresence, photon-scattering, and photobleaching. Our calcium-dependent bioluminescent molecule, Lumicampsin-4 (LMC4), is a split variant of the slow-burn <i>Gaussia</i> luciferase (sb-GLuc). The two elements are joined by the Ca2+-sensing peptide CaM-M13, thereby providing activity detection. Here, we tested the efficacy of LMC4 to track neural dynamics in mouse somatosensory cortex. To date, we have found that CTZ and a Ca2+ driver (NMDA or L-Glutamic Acid) generate robust bioluminescence signals restricted to the area neighboring the injection pipette. In addition, pilot experiments show that vibrissae deflection generates LMC4-mediated bioluminescence in primary somatosensory neocortex. A key future direction will be to assay the reliability of imaging neural activity across multiple areas using LMC4 while animals engage in perceptual tasks.',

      abstract: 'The goal of this project is to assess the feasibility of an all-molecular method for activity-dependent feedback control of neuronal activity. We proposed to generate calcium sensitive light emitting molecules (bioluminescent enzymes, luciferases) that drive light sensing optogenetic elements (channels or ion pumps, opsins) to control membrane voltage at the level of single cells for positive and negative feedback control. By adjusting calcium sensitivity and molecule location, light production can be made specific to large events such as bursts, or sensitive to individual spikes or single channel activity. By coupling these Ca2+-dependent luciferases to opsins, highly specific sensing of calcium at its source will trigger opsin activation for augmenting or suppressing neuronal activity, allowing a high degree of temporal and spatial precision in feedback control. We made significant progress towards our goals by pursuing three aims: 1) Developing a calcium sensing split luciferase with significantly improved speed, brightness and range of sensitivity; 2) Targeting these new molecules to subcellular domains to enable highly specific biological outcomes; 3) Linking these new innovations to optogenetic readouts. The molecular tools generated in the context of our aims will be highly valuable in their own right, specifically for imaging Ca2+ activity independent of external light sources. Our experiments have the potential to lead to a novel strategy to regulate activity only during periods of abnormal neuronal firing. Our strategy is non-invasive and it could be applied to large-scale manipulation of neural activity in behaving animals or in humans, where non-invasive, rapid feedback control of neuronal activity could be used to regulate clinically relevant activity in the brain.',

      abstract: 'The use of genetically-encoded calcium indicators and actuators has fostered significant progress in determining neural circuits underlying behavior and perception. Our team has made fundamental contributions to this domain by developing genetically-encoded molecules capable of tracking neural dynamics and controlling cell activity using bioluminescent probes. Recently, we tested the efficacy of our strategy for controlling neural activity <i>in vivo</i>, a method referred as BioLuminescent-Optogenetics (BL-OG). In BL-OG, cell activity is controlled by optogenetic elements that are activated via bioluminescent light emitted by a luciferase (e.g., slow-burn <i>Gaussia</i> Luciferase, sbGLuc) tethered to opsins. We showed that BL-OG has a large dynamic range for driving spiking activity <i>in vivo</i>, and can be effectively activated using local and systemic injections of the luciferase s substrate, Coelenterazine (CTZ). More recently, we have been testing the efficacy of our genetically-encoded calcium (Ca2+) indicator molecule to track neural dynamics in mouse somatosensory cortex. This molecule, termed LumiCampsin 4 (LMC4), employs a split sbGLuc photoenzyme and connects the two elements with the Ca2+-sensing peptide CaM-M13, ensuring that bioluminescence only occurs in the presence of both Ca2+ and CTZ. We found that bioluminescence was only emitted when both CTZ and a Ca+2 driver (NMDA or L-Glutamic Acid) were injected. Bioluminescence was restricted to the area neighboring the Ca2+ injection pipette, highlighting the spatial selectivity of this molecule. In addition, pilot experiments show that mechanically driving vibrissa generates LMC4-mediated bioluminescence in representations in primary somatosensory neocortex. Together, these data show that our bioluminescent methods can be effective for interrogating and controlling dynamics of neural circuits underlying perception. A future direction is to assay the reliability of imaging neural activity across multiple areas using LMC4 while animals engage in perceptual tasks. These experiments are fundamental to determining whether LMC4 is an effective molecule for probing cross-cortical neural dynamics underlying perception.'

We inserted the CaM-M13 peptide from GCaMP6f into a split slow burn <i>Gaussia</i> luciferase to generate lumicampsin 4, LMC4. Relative to natural and engineered bioluminescent Ca2+ reporters, LMC4 was significantly brighter and, most importantly, had faster peak kinetics; ideal properties for fast calcium reporting. We recently replaced the CaM-M13 module of LMC4 with equivalent modules from other fluorescent and bioluminescent Ca2+ sensors and increased Ca2+ reporter performance even further. 2) We generated LMC4 variants that localize to specific subcellular domains. Ca2+ dynamics vary extensively in subcellular microdomain regions and intracellular organelles. We added specific signaling sequences to LMC4 for organelle (ER, Golgi, Mitochondria) and general membrane-targeting and detected intracellular Ca2+ signals at these locations. We are now assessing LMC4 in primary neurons by combined electrophysiology and photo-detection. 3) I coupled LMC4 to optogenetic elements. We showed silencing of neuronal spiking in cells co-expressing LMC4 and the proton pump Mac. This suggests that Ca2+-dependent light production from LMC4 can activate Mac. We are currently optimizing conditions to achieve reliable and efficient coupling of Ca2+-induced light production and optogenetic effector activation.

    abstract: 'The need to develop efficient therapies for neurodegenerative diseases is urgent, especially given the increasing percentages of the population living longer, with increasing chances of being afflicted with conditions like Parkinson’s Disease (PD). A promising curative approach towards PD and other neurodegenerative diseases is the transplantation of stem cells to halt and potentially reverse neuronal degeneration. However, stem cell therapy suffers from problems with graft efficiency that can lead to adverse side effects and reduced improvement for patients. By using remote stimulation to optogenetically activate cells we attempted to increase graft efficiency. We generated a neuronal precursor cell line expressing luminopsin 3 (LMO3), a luciferase-channelrhodopsin fusion protein, which responds to the luciferase substrate coelenterazine (CTZ) with emission of blue light that in turn activates the opsin. Neuronal precursor cells were injected bilaterally into the striatum of homozygous aphakia mice, which carry a spontaneous mutation leading to lack of dopaminergic neurons and symptoms of PD. Following transplantation, the cells were stimulated over a period of 10 days by intraventricular injections of CTZ. Mice receiving CTZ demonstrated significantly improved motor skills in a rotarod test compared to mice receiving vehicle. Thus, bioluminescent optogenetic stimulation of transplanted neuronal precursor cells shows promising effects in improving graft efficiency in the aphakia PD mouse model and encourages further studies to elucidate the mechanisms and long-term outcomes of the beneficial effects.',

    abstract: 'Current methods used to treat spinal cord injury with stimulation include transcutaneous electrical stimulation at the muscle and intrathecal electrical stimulation. Both of these methods can offer quality of life improvements for patients but are not entirely effective at restoring function. Optogenetic stimulation provides a method of stimulation that can be done at the neuronal level and does not result in the rapid fatigue which occurs as a result of electrical stimulation at the neuronal level. The current drawback of traditional optogenetic stimulation is the invasiveness, as this approach requires an implanted light source. Here we describe a method for the activation of optogenetic constructs in a spinal cord injury model where genetically expressed opsins are activated by a light-producing luciferase that is fused to the opsin (luminopsin). Using this approach, cells expressing the construct are activated by the injection of the luciferase substrate allowing for light to be produced by the luciferase. The light sensitive opsin then opens, allowing for non-selective cation flow, exciting the neuron. We found activation of neurons below the level of injury to significantly improve locomotor recovery following spinal cord injury. This new approach can be applied to distinct populations of endogenous neurons. This is the first example of non-invasive activation of an optogenetic component as a potential therapy following spinal cord injury. This approach can likely be applied to other neurological conditions and may prove to be a useful tool in future therapies for patients. <a class=bl-link href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/710194v1" target="_blank">Read more about this work on bioRxiv.</a>',

    abstract: 'Early development is marked by spontaneous neuronal activity that occurs without the input of sensory experience. This is best demonstrated in the visual system, but has been shown to be a generalized phenomenon. By manipulating this activity in genetically defined neural populations within the prefrontal cortex, we can interfere with the normal formation of specific neural circuits. Many psychiatric disorders are thought to be neurodevelopmental, stemming from malformation of neural circuits. These circuits are primarily found within the prefrontal cortex, where our manipulation will take place. Early disruptions to neural activity may result in behavioral changes that correlate with psychiatric phenotypes typical of disorders such as autism, anxiety, or depression. Using optogenetics, we can manipulate neuronal activity using light. Due to the young age of the animals used in this study, a non-invasive light source must be used. Our laboratory has created mice that conditionally express a luciferase protein, sbGLuc, tethered to a channelrhodopsin, VChR1. This luminescent opsin, or luminopsin (LMO3), produces light, and thus a neuronal response, in the presence of the substrate coelenterazine (CTZ), which can be delivered intraperitoneally (ip). Lox-Stop-Lox LMO3 mice were crossed with Cre driver lines (Emx-1, Dat), thus limiting expression of LMO3 to neuronal populations of interest. By delivering CTZ ip during post-natal days 4-14, alterations in the firing activity of specific neuronal populations can be induced in developing mouse pups. During adulthood, mice are then tested for depressive, anxiety, antisocial, and general locomotive behaviors. The results of this research will provide insight into the effect of altered developmental activity and its relationship to psychiatric disease.'

    abstract:'Optogenetics is the use of light to manipulate light sensing molecules, opsins. Activation of these light-gated ion channels and pumps, when expressed by neurons, results in depolarization or hyperpolarization of cell membranes. This allows activation and silencing of neuronal circuits in behaving experimental animals via light fibers implanted into the animal’s brain. We proposed a strategy for non-invasive optogenetics by switching out the light source from an invasive physical to a non-invasive biological one, i.e., a light producing protein, or luciferase. The luciferase emits light, activating the optogenetic actuator upon application of its small-molecule substrate, coelenterazine (CTZ). We engineered fusion proteins of a light-emitting luciferase to an optogenetic light-responsive element, resulting in a luminescent opsin, or luminopsin. Activation of fused opsins will be more efficient as the light emission of the luciferase increases. One way to increase light output of luciferases is to couple them to fluorescent proteins to take advantage of BRET (bioluminescent resonance energy transfer). This class of probe is far brighter than the parental luciferase enzyme because the quantum efficiency of emission is governed not by the luciferase enzyme, but rather by the fluorescence quantum yield of the BRET acceptor. We performed mutant library screenings in E. coli towards directed evolution of luciferases to improve their enzymatic activity and towards linker length, composition, and domain geometry of BRET probes for optimization of their efficiency. The brightest new BRET probes were codon-optimized and fused to optogenetic actuators. Fusion proteins were expressed in primary cultured neurons and assessed for their effects on activating and silencing neurons in multi electrode arrays (MEAs). New luminopsin constructs had robust expression, increased light emission compared to previously used luciferase variants, and showed efficient activation of opsins by increasing and decreasing spiking of cultured neurons.'

    abstract:'In BioLuminescent driven OptoGenetics (BL-OG) a genetically encoded light source, a luciferase, activates a light-sensing optogenetic element, a channelrhodopsin or a pump. When light emitter and light sensor are tethered, as in luciferase-opsin fusion proteins (luminopsins, LMO), application of luciferase substrate and subsequent light production will change the membrane potential of the cell expressing the LMO. Here we placed the two moieties in pre- and postsynaptic ends of neurons with the goal of achieving BL-OG across the synapse. Neurons isolated from E18 rat cortex were nucleofected either with a pre-synaptically targeted luciferase construct (sbGLuc) or the anion channelrhodopsin iChloC, and were mixed and plated at a 1:1 ratio on 64 electrode 1-well multi-electrode array (MEA) dishes. The above two populations were also individually plated as controls. Silencing of spontaneous neuronal spiking activity through iChloC activation was assessed between DIV 14-21. Blue light (470 nm) from an arc lamp was used to silence iChloC expressing neurons directly, while application of the luciferase substrate coelenterazine (CTZ; final concentration 100μM) was used to silence iChloC expressing neurons across synapses. Assessment of spiking activity showed that for a number of individual electrodes CTZ treatment resulted in a similar pattern of silencing as seen with blue light stimulation. For electrodes that showed similar responses to CTZ treatment and blue light pulses, silencing with CTZ was likely due to trans-synaptic light-activation of iChloC channels. The overall extent of silencing after CTZ application to MEA cultures with mixed populations of luciferase and iChloC expressing neurons was significantly higher compared to cultures of individual populations. Such light activation across synaptic partners, interluminescence, offers the potential to optogenetically dissect synaptic communication in genetically determined neuronal partner populations.'

    abstract:'The development of optogenetics has fostered significant progress in neuroscience by enabling high spatio-temporal control of genetically identified cell populations. Optogenetics is an appealing tool for dissecting neural circuits, and controlling dysfunctional cell ensembles underlying pathological disorders. However, there are several barriers that limit the use of optogenetics <i>in vivo</i>. In particular, invasive devices used for light delivery (e.g., optical fibers) can be perilous because implants represent a potential path for pathogens to reach the brain. Further, targeting multiple disparate foci can be punitive because it requires inserting several optical fibers that may cause tissue damage. To partly meet these needs, we devised the BioLuminescence-OptoGenetics (BL-OG) method, which leverages bioluminescence (BL) to activate optogenetic elements. In our BL-OG construct, the slow-burn <i>Gaussia</i> luciferase (sbGLuc) is tethered to Volvox-Channelrhodopsin1 (VCHR1), and BL is generated when coelenterazine (CTZ), the substrate for <i>Gaussia</i> luciferase, is catalyzed by sbGLuc. While we and others have shown that BL-OG can modulate neural activity, there remain major follow-up questions to demonstrate that BL-OG can be a viable strategy for controlling cells’ activity <i>in vivo</i>. Here, we assayed whether BL-OG can be used as a gain modulator by studying whether increases in BL lead to corresponding changes in neural firing. Further, we probed whether BL-OG enhances cells’ sensitivity to sensory stimuli, and whether BL-OG can be used to track and dynamically control cells’ activity <i>in vivo</i>. We injected the sbGLuc+VCHR1 construct in mice primary somatosensory cortex (SI), and performed simultaneous BL imaging and electrophysiological recordings while stimulating animals’ whiskers prior to and after CTZ injections. Our data revealed a positive relationship between BL and neural firing, and that BL-OG enhanced stimulus-evoked activity of SI neurons. These data indicate that BL-OG systematically regulates cells’ activity <i>in vivo</i>. In a separate set of mice, we injected a calcium-sensitive bioluminescent molecule by splitting the sb-GLuc and linking the components with the calmodulin-M13 peptide sequence. Pilot data revealed increased BL activity during periods of high calcium concentrations. Our data provide evidence that BL-OG can be used to dynamically control the gain of cells <i>in vivo</i>.'

    abstract:'Calcium (Ca2+) is an essential second messenger that is involved in a multitude of physiological functions ranging from cellular apoptosis to neuronal firing. Therefore, <i>in vivo</i> Ca2+ imaging is a very sought after technique. We have split a mutated version of <i>Gaussia</i> luciferase, sbGLuc, known for its high light emission, and introduced the Ca2+ sensing moiety Calmodulin-M13 (CaM-M13) between the two split halves, generating Lumicampsin (LMC). In the presence of both Ca2+ and the luciferase substrate, coelenterazine (CTZ), the enzyme emits light. Since the dynamics of Ca2+ flux vary quite extensively between different organelles and cytoplasmic regions, we have fitted LMC with signaling sequences such that it is localized to various organelles (ER, Golgi, Mitochondria) or is suspended from the inner cell membrane. We transfected HEK293 and Hela cells with these different versions of LMCs and found that they have robust expression, display specific subcellular localization, and faithfully report the calcium dynamics of the site they were localized to. Lastly, LMC reported Ca2+ spikes in Hela cells <i>in vitro</i> and in mouse barrel cortex <i>in vivo</i>.'

    abstract:'Bioluminescence-driven optogenetics can be useful for bimodal opto- and chemogenetic control of neural activity, including both neuronal activation and silencing. Luminopsins (LMOs), which are composed of an opsin fused to a luciferase, have proven to be versatile tools for controlling neuronal activity and interrogating neuronal circuits (PLoS ONE 8: e59759; PNAS 113: E358). Here we have expanded the luminopsin tool kit by fusing a new version of <i>Gaussia</i> luciferase (GLuc) with high light-emission, GLucM23, to depolarizing and hyperpolarizing channelrhodopsins with increased light sensitivity. The combination of GLucM23 with Volvox channelrhodopsin-1, VChR1, produced LMO4, while combining GLucM23 with the anion channelrhodopsin, iChloC, yielded iLMO4. The efficacy of bioluminescence-driven optogenetic activation and silencing was evaluated by whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and multi-electrode array recordings in cultured neurons. Both luminopsins proved very efficient in activating and silencing neurons upon exposure to the luciferase substrate, coelenterazine (CTZ), to generate light emission mediated by GLucM23. The coupling efficiency - a measure of the ability of light generated by GLuc to activate the channelrhodopsins - was higher for LMO4 and iLMO4 than for all previous luminopsins. Moreover, these new LMOs very efficiently controlled neuronal activity <i>in vivo</i>, as indicated by the ability of injected CTZ to alter amphetamine-induced rotations in rats. We conclude that LMO4 and iLMO4 are novel and effective tools that improve bimodal opto- and chemogenetic control of neuronal activity and brain function, from single-cell to behavioral levels.'
